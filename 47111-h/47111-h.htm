<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</a></h2>


<p>In the issue of the <span class="smcap">Pennsylvania
Chronicle and Universal Advertiser</span>
of November 30th-December 3d,
1767, appeared the first of twelve successive
weekly "<i>Letters from a</i> <span class="smcap">Farmer</span> <i>in</i> Pennsylvania
<i>to the Inhabitants of the</i> British
<i>Colonies</i>," in which the attitude assumed
by the British Parliament towards the
American Colonies was exhaustively discussed.
So extensive was their popularity
that they were immediately reprinted in
almost all our Colonial newspapers.</p>

<p>The outbursts of joy throughout America
occasioned by the repeal of the Stamp Act
had scarcely subsided when, the protracted
illness of Lord Chatham having left the
Ministry without a head, the indomitable
Charles Townsend, to the amazement of his
colleagues and unfeigned delight of his
King, introduced measure after measure
under the pretence that they were demanded
by the necessities of the Exchequer;
but in reality for the purpose of
demonstrating the supremacy of the power
of the Parliament of Great Britain over her
colonies in America. Among these Acts
were those which provided for the billeting
of troops in the various colonies; others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
called for duties upon glass, lead, paint, oil,
tea, etc. Of dire portent was the provision
therein, that the revenues thus obtained be
used for the maintenance of a Civil List
in America, and for the payment of the
salaries of the Royal Governors and Justices,
salaries which had hitherto been voted by
the various Assemblies. The Assembly of
New York, having failed to comply strictly
with the letter of the law in regard to the
billeting of the King's troops, was punished
by having its legislative powers suspended.</p>

<p>This action boded ill for the future of any
law-making body in America which should
fail to carry out strictly any measure upon
which the British Parliament might agree.
The Colonies needed a common ground on
which to meet in their opposition to these
arbitrary Acts of Parliament. The deeds of
violence and the tumultuous and passionate
harangues in the northern colonies met
with little sympathy among a large class in
the middle and southern colonies, who,
while chafing under the attacks upon their
liberties, hesitated to favor resistance to the
home government because of their unswerving
loyalty to their King and their love for
the country to whom and to which they
owed allegiance. To these "The Farmer"
appealed when he wrote, "The cause of
liberty is a cause of too much dignity to be
slighted by turbulence and tumult. It
ought to be maintained in a manner suitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
to her nature, those who engage in it should
breathe a sedate yet fervent spirit animating
them to actions of prudence, justice,
modesty, bravery, humanity and magnanimity."
The convincing logic of these letters
clearly proved that the constitutional
rights belonging to Englishmen were being
trampled upon in the colonies, and furnished
a platform upon which all those who
feared their liberties were endangered could
unite.</p>

<p>Under the date of the fifth of November,
1767, the seventy-ninth anniversary of the
day on which the landing of William the
Third at Torbay gave constitutional liberty
to all Englishmen, John Dickinson, of
Pennsylvania (for before long it became
known that he was the illustrious author),
in a letter addressed to his "beloved countrymen,"
called attention to the lack of interest
shown by the Colonies in the act suspending
the legislative powers of New York, and
logically pointed out that the precedent
thereby established was a blow at the liberty
of all the other Colonies, laying particular
emphasis upon the danger of mutual
inattention by the Colonies to the interests
of one another.</p>

<p>The education and training of the author
well qualified him to handle his subject.
Born in 1732 on his ancestral plantation on
the eastern shore of Maryland, from early
youth John Dickinson had had the advantages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
of a classical education.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> His nineteenth
year found him reading law in a lawyer's
office in Philadelphia. Three years later,
he sailed for England, where he devoted
four important years to study at the Middle
Temple, and then and there obtained that
knowledge of English common law and
constitutional history, and imbibed the traditions
of liberty belonging to Englishmen
on which he later founded his plea for the
resistance of the Colonies to the ministerial
attacks upon their liberty. On his return
home he took up the practice of his profession
at Philadelphia, and immediately won
for himself a high place at the Bar. Elected
in 1760 a member of the Assembly of Delaware,
his reputation for ability and political
discernment gained him its speakership.
In 1762 he became a member of the Assembly
of Pennsylvania, where he acquired
great prominence and unpopularity, which
later cost him his seat in that body, on account
of his opposition to the Assembly's
sending a petition to the King praying that
the latter "would <em>resume</em> the government of
the province, making such compensation to
the proprietaries as would be equitable, and
permitting the inhabitants to enjoy under
the new government the privileges that have
been granted to them by and under your
Royal ministries."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span></p>
<p>Possibly Dickinson's knowledge of the
personality of the Ministry and the dominant
spirits in English political circles
gained while abroad, led him bitterly to
attack this measure, fathered and supported
by Franklin, for subsequent events soon
showed the far-sightedness which led him
to distrust the wisdom of a demand for the
revoking of the Proprietary Charter, even
though it were a bad one. His part in the
controversy forced even his bitterest opponents
to admire his ability. The enormous
debt incurred by Great Britain during the
then recent war with France led the Ministry
to look for some way of lightening taxation
at home. It was decided that America
must pay a share toward lifting the
burden resting heavily on those in England,
caused by the financing of the expenses of
a war which drove France from North
America. The fact that the colonies had
furnished, equipped and maintained in the
field twenty-five thousand troops and had
incurred debts far heavier in proportion
than those at home was forgotten. In 1764
was passed the "Sugar Act," which extended
and enlarged the Navigation Acts
and made England the channel through
which not only all European, but also all
Asiatic trade to and from the colonies must
flow. At the same time an announcement
was made that "Stamp Duties" would be
added later on. The next year from Dickinson's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
pen appeared a pamphlet entitled
"<span class="smcap">The LATE REGULATIONS Respecting
the BRITISH COLONIES on the
Continent of AMERICA Considered</span>,
in a Letter from a Gentleman in <span class="smcap">Philadelphia</span>
to his Friend in <span class="smcap">London</span>," in which
these late regulations and proposed measures
were discussed entirely from an economic
standpoint. In it was clearly shown how dependent
were the manufacturers and traders
in England for their prosperity upon the
trade of the colonies and that any restraint
of American trade would naturally curtail
the ability of those in the colonies to purchase
from the home market. The Stamp
Act was opposed on the ground that the
already impoverished colonies would be
drained of all their gold and silver which
necessarily would have to go abroad in the
payment for the stamps. This letter was
conciliatory and persuasive, yet in the closing
pages Dickinson asked:</p>

<p>"What then can we do? Which way
shall we turn ourselves? How may we
mitigate the miseries of our country? <em>Great
Britain</em> gives us an example to guide us?
<span class="smcap">She Teaches us to Make a Distinction
Between Her Interests and Our Own.</span></p>

<p>"Teaches! She requires&mdash;commands&mdash;insists
upon it&mdash;threatens&mdash;compels&mdash;and
even distresses us into it.</p>

<p>"We have our choice of these two
things&mdash;to continue our present limited and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
disadvantageous commerce&mdash;or to promote
manufactures among ourselves, with a habit
of economy, and thereby remove the necessity
we are now under of being supplied by
<i>Great Britain</i>.</p>

<p>"It is not difficult to determine which
of these things is most eligible. Could the
last of them be only so far executed as to
bring our demand for British manufactures
below the profits of our foreign trade, and
the amount of our commodities immediately
remitted home, these colonies might
revive and flourish. States and families are
enriched by the same means; that is, by
being so industrious and frugal as to spend
less than what they raise can pay for."</p>

<p>The various Non-Importation Agreements
signed during the next ten years, bear
testimony to the popularity of the proposed
plan.</p>

<p>This pamphlet circulated freely and increased
Dickinson's reputation as that of a
man capable of thoroughly discussing public
measures; it also brought his name to the
attention of the British public for whom the
"Letter" was especially written.</p>

<p>At the call of Massachusetts, representatives
of nine of the colonies met in New
York in October, 1764, and after a long
discussion (in which Dickinson's knowledge
of constitutional law and English colonial
policy enabled him to assume the leadership)
issued a "Declaration of Rights," in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>
which it was asserted that the inhabitants of
the Colonies, standing on their rights as
Englishmen, could not be taxed by the
House of Commons while unrepresented in
that body. Memorials were sent abroad
protesting against the proposed acts, expressing,
however, their willingness to meet
loyally as in the past any properly accredited
requisitions for funds sent to the various
Assemblies. Notwithstanding this opposition,
and the protests of all friends of America
in England, the Stamp Act was passed.
A year later it was repealed.</p>

<p>Written in a plain, pure style, with illustrations
and arguments drawn from ecclesiastical,
classical and English history, each
point proven with telling accuracy and convincing
logic, conciliatory to the English
people, and filled with expressions of loyalty
to the King, these essays, popularly known
as the "Farmer's Letters," furnished the
basis on which all those who resented the
attacks on their liberty were able to unite.
Town meetings<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and Assemblies vied with
each other in their resolutions of thanks.
The "Letters" were published immediately
in book form in Philadelphia (three different
editions), New York, Boston (two different
editions), Williamsburgh, London (with a
preface written by Franklin), and Dublin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a><br /><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>
Franklin was influential, also, in having
them translated into French, and published
on the Continent. Owing to the beauty of
its typography and the excellence of its
book-making, the Boston edition, published
by Messrs. Mein &amp; Fleeming, has been selected
for republication, and has been reprinted
line for line and page for page, in
a type varying but slightly from that used
by Mein &amp; Fleeming. A few typographical
errors have been corrected, but the irregularities
in spelling, wherever they exist
throughout the various editions, have been
retained. The binding also is a reproduction
of that of the original. Its publication<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
was announced in the "Boston Chronicle,"
March 14-21, 1768, by the advertisement
reprinted on the preceding page.</p>

<p>Valuable as these "Letters" were at
home in uniting all factions in their measures
of resistance, yet their influence abroad
was of even more far-reaching effect. Reprinted
in London in June, 1768, this two-shilling
pamphlet quickly circulated through
coffee-house and drawing-room. In ministerial
circles the "Farmer" caused great
indignation. In a letter from Franklin,
addressed to his son, dated London, 13th of
March, 1768, appears the following: "My
Lord Hillsborough mentioned the 'Farmer's
Letters' to me, said that he had read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span>
them, that they were well written, and he
believed he could guess who was the author,
looking in my face at the same time, as if
he thought it was me. He censured the
doctrines as extremely wild. I have read
them as far as Number 8. I know not if
any more have been published. I should,
however, think they had been written by
Mr. Delancey, not having heard any mention
of the others you point out as joint
authors."</p>

<p>Groaning under their own heavy taxation,
the troubles of America had hitherto
appealed but slightly to the average Englishman
and the sympathies of the English
people had become involved in the long-drawn-out
struggles of Wilkes to obtain his
constitutional rights. The press published
little American news. America was little
discussed; conditions there were practically
unknown to all but the trading class, whose
members had prospered through the monopoly
of the constantly increasing commerce
with the growing colonies. This class,
naturally fearing the loss of the magnificent
trade which had been built up, had long
bemoaned the constantly increasing friction
between the two factions on each side of
the water. Englishmen in general had
hitherto paid little attention to the debates
over the various acts raising revenue from
the colonies. From the time the "Farmer's
Letters" were published in England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span>
the differences between Parliament and
colonies were better understood there.
Untouched and yet alarmed by the political
corruption so prevalent at the time, thinking
men saw in these "Letters" a warning that
if their Sovereign was successful in his
attempt to take away constitutional liberty
from their fellow Englishmen across the
sea, their own prized liberty at home was
in danger. "American" news became
more frequent in the newspapers, "Letters
to the Printer," the form of editorials of
the day, discussed and criticised the measures
of Parliament with great freedom.
To the masses, John Dickinson's name soon
became very familiar through the agency
of the press, which under date of June 26-28,
1768, freely noted Isaac Barré's characterization
in the House of Commons of
Dickinson as "a man who was not only an
ornament to his country but an honor to
human nature." Almost immediately after
the publication of the London edition, the
Monthly Review of July, 1768, forcibly
called the attention of the literary world to
the "Farmer's Letters" in an exhaustive
review which is reprinted in the Notes, page
liii, for the purpose of showing the view held
by the English Whigs regarding the doctrines
laid down and arguments used by
Dickinson in defence of his position.</p>

<p>The "London Chronicle," under date of
September 1st, 1768, printed the popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</a></span>
Liberty song, written by Mr. Dickinson,
and which, set to the inspiring air of
"Hearts of Oak," was being sung throughout
the colonies. In order to give the
accompanying letter of request for the republication
of the song, a request which,
from its wording demonstrates the enthusiasm
which the song aroused, the latter is
here reprinted from the issue of the Boston
"Evening Post" of August 22, 1768.</p>

<p>The following extract from the London
"Chronicle" of October 4, 1768, demonstrates
how completely the arguments and
logic of the "Farmer's Letters" gained popular
approval; how constantly Dickinson's
name was kept before the public, both at
home and abroad; how his fame was toasted;
how he was recognized as the leader of
political thought in the colonies. It shows
also the constantly increasing interest in
American matters taken by the press of
England since the advent of the "Farmer's
Letters," for the "American News," published
in this and other London papers,
was extensively reprinted in the local journals
throughout the kingdom.</p>


<p><i>Taken from the Boston, in New England, Evening
Post of August 22, 1768</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>On Monday the fifteenth instant, the anniversary
of the ever memorable <em>Fourteenth of August</em>,
was celebrated by the Sons of Liberty in this
Town, with extraordinary festivity. At this Dawn,
the British Flag was displayed on the <em>Tree of Liberty</em>,
and a Discharge of <em>Fourteen</em> Cannon, ranged
under the venerable Elm, saluted the joyous Day.
At eleven o'clock, a very large Company of the
principal Gentlemen and respectable Inhabitants
of the Town, met at the Hall under the Tree,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[xxxii]</a></span>
while the Streets were crowded with a Concourse
of People of all Ranks, public Notice having been
given of the intended Celebration. The Musick
began at high Noon, performed on various Instruments,
joined with Voices; and concluding with
the universally admired <em>American</em> Song of Liberty,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
the Grandeur of its Sentiment, and the easy
Flow of its Numbers, together with an exquisite
Harmony of Sound, afforded sublime Entertainment
to a numerous Audience, fraught with a
noble Ardour in the cause of Freedom: The Song
was clos'd with the Discharge of Cannon and a
Shout of Joy; at the same time the Windows of
the Neighbouring Houses, were adorned with a
brilliant appearance of the fair Daughters of Liberty,
who testified their Approbation by Smiles of
Satisfaction. The following Toasts succeeded,
viz.</p>

<p>
The following toasts may need brief explanation.&mdash;R. T. H. H.:
</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>1. Our rightful Sovereign George the Third.</i>
</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>2. The Queen, Prince of Wales, and the rest of
the Royal Family.</i></p>

<p class="hanging"><i>3. The Sons of Liberty throughout the World.</i>
</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>4. The glorious Administration of 1766.</i>

<p class="hanging"><i>5. A perpetual Union of Great Britain and her
Colonies, upon the immutable Principles of

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[xxxiii]</a></span></p>

<p class="hanging"><i>8. Paschal Paoli and his brave Corsicans. May
they never want the Support of the Friends of

<p>9. The day of the demonstration in Boston against the Stamp
Officers. Daybreak disclosed hanging on a tree an effigy of the
Stamp Officer Oliver. After hanging all day, at nightfall it was
taken down by the Sons of Liberty, who placed it on a bier and escorted
it through the principal streets in Boston to the home of Oliver,
where, in the presence of a large number of people, it was burned.</p>

<p class="hanging">10. <i>Magna Charta, and the Bill of Rights.</i></p>

Rights of America, uninfluenced by the Mandates
of a Minister, and undaunted by the
threats of a Governor.</i></p>

<p>14. On the 11th day of February, 1768, the Assembly of Massachusetts
adopted and sent to the various Colonial Assemblies a
circular letter drawn up by Samuel Adams, informing them of the
contents of a petition which the Massachusetts Assembly had sent
to the King. This letter also urged united action against the oppressive
measures of the Ministry, and gave great offense to the
King and Ministry. The Secretary for the Colonies, Lord Hillsborough,
instructed Governor Bernard of Massachusetts to order
the Assembly to rescind this letter, and in case of refusal to dissolve
this body. After a thorough discussion this request was refused
by a vote of "ninety-two" to "seventeen."</p>

<p>Which being finished, the French horns
sounded; and after another discharge of the cannon,
compleating the number Ninety-Two, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[xxxiv]</a></span>
gentlemen in their carriages repaired to the Greyhound
Tavern in Roxbury, where a <em>frugal</em> and
<em>elegant</em> entertainment was provided. The music
played during the repast: After which the following
toasts were given out, and the repeated discharge

<p>
Upon this happy occasion, the whole company
with the approbation of their brethren in Roxbury,
consecrated a tree in the vicinity; under the shade
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[xxxviii]</a></span>of which, on some future anniversary, they say they
shall commemorate the day, which shall liberate
America from her present oppression! Then
making an agreeable excursion round Jamaica
Pond, in which excursion they received the kind
salutation of a Friend to the cause by the discharge
of cannon at six o'clock they returned to Town;
and passing in slow and orderly procession
through the principal streets, and the State-House,
they retired to their respective dwellings. It is
allowed that this cavalcade surpassed all that has
ever been seen in America. The joy of the day
was manly, and an uninterrupted regularity presided
through the whole.</p>

<p>The two illustrations in this volume were
selected for the purpose of recording prevalent
contemporary opinions of Dickinson.</p>

<p>The frontispiece is a reproduction (slightly
reduced in size)<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> of the very scarce
print in which John Dickinson is crudely
portrayed as the author of the "Farmer's
Letters." It was first advertised for sale in
the Pennsylvania "Chronicle" under date
of October 12-17, 1768, as follows:
</p>

<p class="center">
Lately published and sold by R. Bell<br />
at <span class="smcap">James Emerson's</span>, in Market-street,<br />
near the river, and at <span class="smcap">John<br />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[xxxix]</a></span></p>
<p>This specimen of early American engraving,
the work of some unknown artist and
engraver, was undoubtedly inspired by the
following article which appeared in the
Pennsylvania "Chronicle" for May, 9-16,
1768, as well as the many other newspapers
in the colonies, so eager was the press to
publish any information concerning the
author of the "Farmer's Letters." The
inscription is thus explained as well as the
elimination of the vowels from Dickinson's
name.</p>

PHILADELPHIA
</p>

<p>On Tuesday last, by order of the Governor
and Society of Fort St. David's, fourteen Gentlemen,
members of that Company, waited upon J-n
D-ck-nson Esq; and presented the following address,
in a Box of Heart of Oak.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Respected Sir</span>,</p>

<p>When a Man of Abilities, prompted by Love of
his Country, exerts them in her Cause, and renders
her the most eminent Services, <em>not to be sensible</em>,
of the Benefits received, is Stupidity; <em>not to be grateful
for them</em>, is Baseness.</p>

<p>Influenced by this Sentiment, we, the Governor
and Company of Fort St. David's, who among other
Inhabitants of <i>British America</i>, are indebted to you
for your most excellent and generous Vindication of
Liberties dearer to us than our Lives, beg Leave to
return you our heartiest Thanks, and offer to you
the greatest Mark of Esteem, that, as a Body, it is
in our Power to bestow, by admitting you, as we
hereby do, a Member of our Society.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[xl]</a></span></p>

<p>When that destructive Project of <i>Taxation</i>, which
your Integrity and Knowledge so signally contributed
to baffle about two years ago, was lately renewed
under a <i>Disguise</i> so <em>artfully contrived</em> as to
delude Millions, You, sir, <em>watchful</em> for the Interests
of Your Country, <em>perfectly</em> acquainted with them,
and <em>undaunted</em> in asserting them, <span class="smcap">Alone</span> detected the
Monster concealed from others by an altered Appearance,
exposed it, stripped of its insidious covering,
in its own horrid Shape, and, we firmly trust
by the Blessing of God on Your Wisdom and Virtue,
will again extricate the <em>British</em> Colonies on this
Continent from the cruel Snares of Oppression; for
we already perceive these Colonies <small>ROUSED</small> <em>by your
strong and seasonable</em> Call, pursuing the salutary
Measures advised by You for obtaining Redress.</p>

<p>Nor is this all that you have performed for Your
<span class="smcap">native Land</span>. <em>Animated by a sacred</em> Zeal, <em>guided
by Truth and supported by Justice</em>, <span class="smcap">You</span> <em>have penetrated
to the Foundations of the Constitution</em>, have
<em>poured</em> the clearest Light on the important <em>Points</em>,
hitherto involved in a Darkness bewildering even
the Learned, and have <em>established</em> with an amazing
Force and Plainness of Argument, the <small>TRUE DISTINCTIONS</small>
and <small>GRAND PRINCIPLES</small>, that will <em>fully instruct
Ages</em> <small>YET UNBORN</small>, what Rights belong to
them, and the best Methods of defending them.</p>

<p>To Merit far less distinguished, ancient <i>Greece</i> or
<i>Rome</i> would have decreed Statues and Honours without
Number: But it is <em>Your Fortune</em> and <em>your
Glory</em>, Sir, that You live in <em>such</em> Times, and possess
<em>such exalted Worth</em>, that the <em>Envy</em> of those, whose
<em>Duty</em> it is to applaud You, can conceive no other
Consolation, than by withholding those Praises in
Public, which all honest Men acknowledge in Private
that you have deserved.</p>

<p>We present to you, sir, a small gift of a Society
not dignified by any legal authority; But
when you consider this gift as expressive of the
<em>sincere Affection</em> of many of your Fellow Citizens
for Your Person, and of their <em>unlimited Approbation</em>
of the noble Principles maintained in your unequalled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[xli]</a></span>
Labours, we hope this Testimony of our
Sentiments will be acceptable to you.</p>

<p>May that all-gracious Being, which in kindness
to these colonies gave your valuable Life Existence

character held by William Duesbury, England's
greatest manufacturer of porcelain. It
pictures a porcelain statuette of Mrs. Catherine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[xliii]</a><br /><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">[xliv]</a><br /><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">[xlv]</a></span>
Macaulay, a well-known historian, whose
"History of England from the Accession of
James the First to that of the Brunswick
Line" and other historical writings met with
great approval among the Whig party in
England and whose decided approval of the
stand taken by the colonies, gave her great
popularity in America. This statuette, measuring
13<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub> inches in height, is modeled to a
certain extent after the statue of this lady
which was erected in 1777 in the Church of
St. Stephen, Walbrook, London. Mrs.
Macaulay appears leaning upon her "Histories
of England," which rest on the top of
a pedestal, on the front of which is the inscription,
"Government a Power Delegated
for the Happiness of Mankind conducted by
Wisdom, Justice and Mercy." Beneath are
the words, "<i>American Congress</i>." On the side
of the pedestal the name of <i>Dickinson</i> appears,
preceded by the names of those noble
writers, England's great advocates and expounders
of Constitutional liberty, Sydney,
Hampden, Milton, Locke, Harrington,
Ludlow and Marvel. This beautiful porcelain
statuette was moulded at the Chelsea
factory in 1777, the same year in which
Boswell chronicles Dr. Johnson's visit there,
noting, "The china was beautiful, but Dr.
Johnson justly observed it was too dear, for
he could have vessels of silver as cheap as
were here made of porcelain."</p>

<p>The space at my disposal prevents my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi">[xlvi]</a></span>
quoting many a "Letter to the Printer"
appealing for justice for the Colonials as
well as numerous contributed articles which
appeared during the next few years in the
English press, the contents of which clearly
show how strongly Dickinson's arguments
had influenced their respective authors.
While it is true that these sentiments were
attacked both at home and abroad, the
attacks soon lost their vehemence. Strange
as it may seem, more protests against the
course of the ministry than denunciations
of the doings of the colonial Assemblies are
found in the columns of the English press
of the period. The demand for the arguments
contained in the "Farmer's Letters"
was not lessened by subsequent events as
their popularity demanded the publishing
of another London edition in 1774.</p>

<p>Certainly to John Dickinson for his
masterly defence of the rights of the Colonies
America owes an everlasting debt of
gratitude. The logic of his claims and his
warnings as to what must be the ultimate
result of the ministerial encroachments upon
the liberties of Englishmen did much to
win over to the American cause in England
that strong ally, the support of a large body
of thoughtful Englishmen. These men
actively condemned the ministerial actions
and during the war which followed caused
the course of the government to be bitterly
opposed by an influential and constantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvii" id="Page_xlvii">[xlvii]</a></span>
growing minority in Parliament. Through
their efforts was fostered a public sentiment
which caused the war to be prosecuted
in a half-hearted manner and obliged
a power-loving King to fill the depleted
ranks of his army with German mercenaries,
so impossible was it to force a sufficient number
of his own liberty-loving subjects to fight
against their kindred living in the land so
happily alluded to by a contributor to the
London "Chronicle" (June 3-6, 1769),
in the following poem:</p>

<p>An address from the Moderator and Freemen
of the Town of Providence in the
Colony of Rhode-Island, and Providence Plantation
convened in open Meeting the 20th day of June,
1768, to the Author of a Series of Letters signed</p>

<p class="center">
A FARMER.
</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Sir</i>,</p>

<p>In your Retirement, "near the Banks of the
River Delaware," where you are compleating, in a
rational way, the Number of Days allotted to
you by Divine Goodness, the consciousness of
having employed those Talents which God hath
bestowed upon You, for the Support of our
Rights, must afford you a Satisfaction vastly exceeding
that, which is derived to you from the
universal Approbation of Your Letters,&mdash;However
amidst the general Acclamation of your
Praise, we the Moderator and Freemen of the
ancient Town of Providence cannot be silent;
although we would not offend your Delicacy, or
incur the Imputation of Flattery in expressing our
Gratitude to you.</p>

<p>Your Benevolence to Mankind, fully discoverable
from your Writings, doubtless caused you to
address your countrymen, whom you tenderly
call <em>Dear</em> and <em>Beloved</em>, in a Series of Letters,
wherein you have with a great Judgment, and in
the most spirited and forcible Manner explained
their Rights and Privileges; and vindicated them
against such as would reduce these extensive Dominions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lii" id="Page_lii">[lii]</a></span>
of His Majesty to Poverty, Misery, and
Slavery. This Your patriotic Exertion in our
Cause and indeed in the Cause of all the human
Race in some Degree, hath rendered you very dear
to us, although we know not your Person.</p>

<p>We deplore the Frailty of human Nature, in
that it is necessary that we should be frequently
awakened into Attention to our Duty in Matters
very plain and incontrovertible, if we would suffer
ourselves to consider them. From this Inattention
to Things evidently the Duty and Interest of the
World, we suppose despotic Rule to have originated,
and all the Train of Miseries consequent
thereupon.</p>

<p>The virtuous and good Man, who rouses an
injured Country from their Lethargy, and animates
them into active and successful Endeavours for
casting off the Burdens imposed on them, and effecting
a full Enjoyment of the Rights of Men,
which no Human Creature ought to violate, will
merit the warmest Expressions of Gratitude from
his Countrymen, for his Instrumentality in saving
them and their Posterity.</p>

<p>As the very Design of instituting civil Government
in the World was to secure to Individuals a
quiet Enjoyment of their native Rights, wherever
there is a Departure from this great and only
End, impious Force succeeds. The Blessings of
a just Government, and the Horror of brutal
Violence are both inexpressible. As the latter is
generally brought upon People by Degrees, it will
be their Duty to watch against even the smallest
attempt to "innovate a single Iota" in their
Privilege.</p>

<p>With Hearts truly loyal to the King, we feel
the greatest concern at divers Acts of the British
Parliament, relative to these colonies. We are
clear and unanimous in Sentiment that they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liii" id="Page_liii">[liii]</a></span>
subversive of our Liberties, and derogatory to the
Power and Dignity of the several Legislatures established
in America.</p>

<p>Permit us, Sir, to assure you that we feel an ineffable
Gratitude to you, for sending forth your
Letters at a Time when the Exercise of great
Abilities was necessary. We sincerely wish that
You may see the Fruit of your Labours. We on
our parts shall be ready at all Times to evince to
the World that we will not surrender our privileges
to any of our Fellow Subjects, but will earnestly
contend for them, hoping that the "Almighty
will look upon our righteous contest with
gracious approbation." We hope that the Conduct
of the Colonies on this Occasion will be
"peaceable, prudent, firm, and joint; and such as
will show their Loyalty to the best of Sovereigns,
and that they know what they owe to themselves
as well as to Great-Britain."</p>

<h3>FROM THE MONTHLY REVIEW.
LONDON, JULY, 1768.</h3>

<p class="hanging">"<i>Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania, to the
Inhabitants of the British Colonies. 8vo. 2s.
Almon. 1768.</i></p>

<p>"We have, in the Letters now before us, a calm
yet full inquiry into the right of the British parliament,
lately assumed, to tax the American colonies;
the unconstitutional nature of which attempt
is maintained in a well-connected chain of
close and manly reasoning; and though from this
character, it is evident that detached passages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liv" id="Page_liv">[liv]</a></span>
must appear to a disadvantage, yet it is but just
to give our Readers some specimens of the manner
in which the author asserts the rights of his
American brethren; subjects of the British government,
as he pleads, carrying their birthrights
with them wherever they settle as such.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Colonies, says he, were formerly planted by
warlike nations, to keep their enemies in awe; to
relieve their country overburthened with inhabitants;
or to discharge a number of discontented
and troublesome citizens. But in more modern
ages, the spirit of violence being, in some measure,
if the expression may be allowed, sheathed in commerce,
colonies have been settled by the nations of
Europe for the purposes of trade. These purposes
were to be attained, by the colonies raising for their
mother country those things which she did not produce
herself; and by supplying themselves from
her with things they wanted. These were the <em>national</em>
objects in the commencement of our colonies,
and have been uniformly so in their promotion.</p>

<p>'To answer these grand purposes, perfect liberty
was known to be necessary; all history proving, that
trade and freedom are nearly related to each other.
By a due regard to this wise and just plan, the infant
colonies, exposed in the unknown climates
and unexplored wildernesses of this new world,
lived, grew, and flourished.</p>

<p>'The parent country, with undeviating prudence
and virtue, attentive to the first principles of colonization,
drew to herself the benefits she might
reasonably expect, and preserved to her children
the blessings, upon which those benefits were
founded. She made laws, obliging her colonies to
carry to her all those products which she wanted
for her own use; and all those raw materials which
she chose herself to work up. Besides this restriction,
she forbade them to procure <em>manufactures</em> from
any other part of the globe, or even the <em>products</em> of
<i>European</i> countries, which alone could rival her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lv" id="Page_lv">[lv]</a></span>
without being first brought to her. In short, by a
variety of laws, she regulated their trade in such a
manner as she thought most conducive to their mutual
advantage and her own welfare. A power was
reserved to the crown of <em>repealing</em> any laws that
should be enacted: the executive authority of government
was also lodged in the crown, and its representatives;
and an <em>appeal</em> was secured to the
crown from all judgments in the administration of
justice.</p>

<p>'For all these powers, established by the mother
country over the colonies; for all these immense
emoluments derived by her from them; for all their
difficulties and distresses in fixing themselves, what
was the recompense made them? A communication
of her rights in general, and particularly of that
great one, the foundation of all the rest&mdash;that their
property, acquired with so much pain and hazard,
should be disposed of by none but themselves&mdash;or,
to use beautiful and emphatic language of the sacred
scriptures, "that they should sit <em>every man</em> under his
vine, and under his fig-tree, and <em>none should make
them afraid</em>."</p>

<p>'Can any man of candour and knowledge deny
that these institutions form an affinity between
Great Britain and her colonies, that sufficiently secures
their dependence upon her? Or that for her
to levy taxes upon them is to reverse the nature of
things? Or that she can pursue such a measure
without reducing them to a state of vassalage?</p>

<p>'If any person cannot conceive the supremacy
of Great Britain to exist, without the power of
laying taxes to levy money upon us, the history of
the colonies, and of Great Britain, since their settlement,
will prove the contrary. He will there
find the amazing advantages arising to her from
them&mdash;the constant exercise of her supremacy&mdash;and
their filial submission to it, without a single
rebellion, or even the thought of one, from their
first emigration to this moment&mdash;and all these
things have happened, without one instance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lvi" id="Page_lvi">[lvi]</a></span>
Great Britain's laying taxes to levy money upon
them.</p>

<p>'How many British authors have demonstrated,
that the present wealth, power and glory of their
country, are founded upon these colonies? As
constantly as streams tend to the ocean have they
been pouring the fruits of all their labours into
their mother's lap. Good heaven! and shall a total
oblivion of former tendernesses and blessings, be
spread over the minds of a good and wise nation by
the sordid arts of intriguing men, who, covering their
selfish projects under pretences of public good, first
enrage their countrymen into a frenzy of passion,
and then advance their own influence and interest,
by gratifying the passion, which they themselves
have basely excited.</p>

<p>'Hitherto Great Britain has been contented with
her prosperity, moderation has been the rule of her
conduct. But now, a generous, humane people,
that so often have protected the liberty of <em>strangers</em>,
is inflamed into an attempt to tear a privilege from
her own children, which if executed, must, in their
opinion, sink them into slaves: <em>and for what</em>? for
a pernicious power, not necessary to her as her own
experience may convince her; but horribly dreadful
and detestable to her.</p>

<p>'It seems extremely probable, that when cool,
dispassionate prosperity, shall consider the affectionate
intercourse, the reciprocal benefits, and the unsuspecting
confidence, that have subsisted between
these colonies and their parent country, for such a
length of time, they will execrate, with the bitterest
curses, the infamous memory of those men,
whose pestilential ambition unnecessarily, wantonly,
first opened the sources of civil discord between
them; first turned their love into jealousy; and first
taught these provinces, filled with grief and anxiety,
to enquire.'</p></blockquote>

<p>"As every community possessed of valuable
privileges, and desirous to preserve the enjoyment
of them, ought to be very cautious of admitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lvii" id="Page_lvii">[lvii]</a></span>
innovations from their established forms of political
administration, our Author does not confine
his views to the immediate effects of the laws lately
passed regarding America; but considers the necessary
tendency of the precedents; thus he says,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'I have looked over every <em>statute</em> relating to these
colonies, from their first settlement to this time;
and I find everyone of them founded on this principle,
till the <em>stamp-act</em> administration. <em>All before</em>,
are calculated to regulate trade, and preserve or promote
a mutually beneficial intercourse between the
several constituent parts of the empire; and though
many of them imposed duties on trade, yet those
duties were always imposed <em>with design</em> to restrain
the commerce of one part, that was injurious to another,
and thus to promote the general welfare.
The raising a revenue thereby was never intended.
Thus, the king by his judges in his courts of justice,
impose fines, which altogether amount to a very considerable
sum, and contribute to the support of government;
but this is merely a consequence arising
from restrictions, that only meant to keep peace,
and prevent confusion; and surely a man would
argue very loosely, who should conclude from hence,
that the king has a right to levy money in general
upon his subjects. Never did the British parliament,
till the period above mentioned, think of imposing
duties in America, <em>for the purpose of raising a
revenue</em>. Mr. Grenville first introduced this language,
in the preamble to the fourth of George
III. chap. 15, which has these words&mdash;"and whereas
it is just and necessary that <em>a revenue be raised in your
majesty's said dominions in America, for defraying the
expenses of defending, protecting and securing the same</em>:
We your majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects,
<em>the commons of Great Britain</em>, in Parliament assembled,
being desirous to make some provisions in this
present session of parliament, <em>towards raising the said
revenue in America</em>, have resolved to <em>give</em> and <em>grant</em>
unto your majesty the several rates and duties hereinafter
mentioned," etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lviii" id="Page_lviii">[lviii]</a></span></p>

<p>'A few months after came the <em>stamp-act</em>, which
reciting this, proceeds in the same strange mode of
expression, thus&mdash;"And whereas it is just and necessary,
that provision be made <em>for raising a further
revenue within your majesty's dominions in America, towards
defraying the said expenses</em>, we your majesty's
most dutiful and loyal subjects, the <em>commons</em> of
<em>Great Britain, etc., give and grant</em>," etc., as before.</p>

<p>'The last act, granting duties upon paper, etc.,
carefully pursues these modern precedents. The
preamble is, "Whereas it is expedient, <em>that a revenue
should be raised in your majesty's dominions in America
for making a more certain and adequate provision for
defraying the charge of the administration of justice,
and the support of civil government in such provinces,
where it shall be found necessary; and towards the
further defraying of the expences of defending, protecting,
and securing the said dominions</em>, we your majesty's
most dutiful and loyal subjects, the <em>commons
of Great Britain</em>, etc. give <em>and grant</em>," etc. as before.</p>

<p>'Here we may observe an authority expresly claimed
and exerted to impose duties on these colonies;
not for the regulation of trade; not for the preservation
or promotion of a mutually beneficial intercourse
between the several constituent parts of the
empire, heretofore the <em>sole objects</em> of parliamentary
institutions; <em>but for the single purpose of levying money
upon us</em>.'</p></blockquote>

<p>"Again in another place,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'What but the indisputable, the acknowledged
exclusive right of the colonies to tax themselves,
could be the reason, that in this long period of
more than one hundred and fifty years, no statute
was ever passed for the sole purpose of raising a
revenue from the colonies? And how clear, how
cogent must that reason be, to which every parliament,
and every ministry for so long a time submitted,
without a single attempt to innovate?</p>

<p>'England, in part of that course of years, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lix" id="Page_lix">[lix]</a></span>
Great Britain, in other parts, was engaged in several
fierce and expensive wars; troubled with some
tumultuous and bold parliaments; governed by
many daring and wicked ministers; yet none of
them ever ventured to touch the Palladium of
American liberty. Ambition, avarice, faction,
tyranny, all revered it. Whenever it was necessary
to raise money on the colonies, the requisitions of
the crown were made, and dutifully complied with.
The parliament, from time to time, regulated their
trade, and that of the rest of the empire, to preserve
their dependence and the connections of the
whole in good order.'</p></blockquote>

<p>"The amount of present duties exacted in an
unusual way is no part of the object in question;
for our Pennsylvanian Farmer observes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Some persons may think this act of no consequence,
because the duties are so <em>small</em>. A fatal
error. <em>That</em> is the very circumstance most alarming
to me. For I am convinced, that the authors
of this law would never have obtained an
act to raise so trifling a sum as it must do, had
they not intended by it to establish a <em>precedent</em> for
future use. To console ourselves with the <em>smallness</em>
of the duties, is to walk deliberately into the
snare that is set for us, praising the <em>neatness</em> of the
workmanship. Suppose the duties imposed by the
late act could be paid by these distressed colonies
with the utmost ease, and that the purposes to which
they are to be applied, were the most reasonable
and equitable that can be conceived, the contrary
of which I hope to demonstrate before these letters
are concluded; yet even in such a supposed case,
these colonies ought to regard the act with abhorrence.
For who are a free people? Not those,
over whom government is reasonably and equitably
exercised, but those, who live under a government
so <em>constitutionally checked</em> and controuled, that proper
provision is made against its being otherwise exercised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lx" id="Page_lx">[lx]</a></span></p>

<p>'The late act is founded on the destruction of
this constitutional security. If the parliament have
a right to lay a duty of four shillings and eight
pence on a hundred weight of glass, or a ream of
paper, they have a right to lay a duty of any other
sum on either. They may raise the duty, as the
author before quoted says has been done in some
countries, till it "exceeds seventeen or eighteen
times the value of the commodity." In short, if
they have a right to levy a tax of <em>one penny</em> upon
us, they have a right to levy a <em>million</em> upon us; for
where does their right stop? At any given number
of pence, shillings or pounds? To attempt to
limit their right, after granting it to exist at all,
is as contrary to reason&mdash;as granting it to exist at
all, is contrary to justice. If they have any right
to tax us&mdash;then, whether our own money shall
continue in our pockets or not, depends no longer
on <em>us</em>, but on <em>them</em>, "There is nothing which "we"
can call our own; or, to use the words of Mr.
Locke&mdash;<em>what property have "we" in that which
another may, by right, take, when he pleases, to himself</em>?"</p>

<p>'These duties which will inevitably be levied upon
us&mdash;which are now levying upon us&mdash;are <em>expresly
laid for the sole purpose of taking money</em>. This is the
true definition of "taxes." They are therefore
<em>taxes</em>. This money is to be taken from <em>us</em>. We are
therefore <em>taxed</em>. <em>Those</em> who are <em>taxed</em> without their
own consent, expressed by themselves or their representatives
are <em>slaves</em>. <em>We are taxed</em> without our
own consent, expressed by ourselves or representatives.
<em>We</em> are therefore slaves.'</p></blockquote>

<p>"Further,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Indeed nations in general are more apt to <em>feel</em>
than to <em>think</em>; and therefore nations in general
have lost their liberty: for as the violation of the
rights of the governed are commonly not only <em>specious</em>,
but <em>small</em> at the beginning, they spread over
the multitude in such a manner, as to touch individuals
but slightly; thus they are disregarded. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxi" id="Page_lxi">[lxi]</a></span>
power or profit that arises from these violations,
<em>centering in a few persons</em>, is to them considerable.
For this reason, the <em>Governors</em> having in view their
particular purposes, successively preserve an uniformity
of conduct for attaining them: they regularly
increase and multiply the first injuries, till at
length the inattentive people are compelled to perceive
the heaviness of their burthen. They begin
to complain and inquire&mdash;but too late. They find
their oppressions so strengthened by success, and
themselves so entangled in examples of express
authority on the part of their rulers, and of tacit
recognition on their own part, that they are quite
confounded: for millions entertain no other idea of
the <em>legality</em> of power, than that it is founded on the
exercise of power. They then voluntarily fasten
their chains by adopting a pusillanimous opinion
"that there will be too much danger in attempting
a remedy"&mdash;or another opinion no less fatal, "that
the government has a <em>right</em> to treat them as it
does." They then seek a wretched relief for their
minds, by persuading themselves, that to yield their
<em>obedience</em>, is to discharge their <em>duty</em>. The <em>deplorable</em>
poverty of spirit, that prostrates all the dignity bestowed
by Divine Providence on our nature&mdash;of
course succeeds.'</p></blockquote>

<p>"With regard to the proper conduct of the colonies
on this occasion he premises the following
questions:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Has not the parliament <em>expressly avowed</em> their
<em>intention</em> of raising money from us for <em>certain</em> purposes?
Is not this scheme <em>popular</em> in Great Britain?
Will the taxes imposed by the late act, <em>answer</em> those
purposes? If it will, must it not take an immense
sum from us? If it will not, is it to be <em>expected</em>, that
the parliament will not <em>fully execute</em> their <em>intention</em>,
when it is pleasing at home, <em>and not opposed</em> here?
Must not this be done by imposing <em>new taxes</em>? Will
not every addition thus made to our taxes, be an addition
to the power of the British legislature, <em>by
increasing the number of officers</em> employed in the collection?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxii" id="Page_lxii">[lxii]</a></span>
Will not every additional tax therefore
render it <em>more difficult</em> to abrogate any of them?
When a branch of revenue is once established, does
it not appear to many people <em>invidious</em> and undutiful,
to attempt to abolish it? If taxes sufficient to
<em>accomplish</em> the intention of the parliament, are imposed
by the parliament, what taxes will remain to
be imposed by our assemblies? If <em>no material</em> taxes
remain to be imposed by them, what must become
of <em>them</em>, and the people they represent?'</p></blockquote>

<p>"Our Author all along, however, asserts that the
real interest of English America consists in its
proper dependence on the mother country, at the
same time that he strenuously exhorts his countrymen
to oppose, by all the suitable means in their
power, every incroachment on those constitutions
under the sanction of which they settled on those
remote and uncultivated shores, whereon they
have so industriously established themselves. He
remarks with a spirit which no one, it is apprehended,
can condemn:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'I am no further concerned in anything affecting
America, than any one of you; and when liberty
leaves it, I can quit it much more conveniently than
most of you: but while divine providence, that gave
me existence in a land of freedom, permits my head
to think, my lips to speak, and my hands to move,
I shall so highly and gratefully value the blessing
received, as to take care, that my silence and inactivity
shall not give my implied assent to any act,
degrading my brethren and myself from the birthright,
wherewith heaven itself "hath made us
free.'</p></blockquote>

<p>"The consequence of Great Britain exerting
this disagreeable power, he shews, in a long train
of arguments, to have a tendency very fatal to the
liberty of America, which he illustrates by examining
into the application of the pensions on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxiii" id="Page_lxiii">[lxiii]</a></span>
Irish establishment; and sums up his reasoning
with the following positions:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Let these <em>truths</em> be indelibly impressed on our
mind&mdash;<em>that we cannot be</em> happy, <em>without being</em> free&mdash;that
we cannot be free, <em>without being secure</em>&mdash;in our
property&mdash;that we cannot be secure in our property,
if, <em>without our consent, others may, as by right, take it
away&mdash;that taxes imposed on us by parliament</em>, do thus
take it away&mdash;that <em>duties laid for the sole purposes of
raising money</em>, are taxes&mdash;that attempts to lay such
duties <em>should be instantly and firmly opposed</em>&mdash;that this
opposition can never be effectual, unless it is the
united effort of those provinces&mdash;that therefore <em>benevolence
of temper towards each other</em>, and <em>unanimity
of counsels</em>, are essential to the welfare of the whole&mdash;and
lastly, that for this reason, every man amongst
us, who in any manner would encourage either dissention,
diffidence, or indifference, between these
colonies, is an enemy to <em>himself</em>, and to <em>his
country</em>.</p>

<p>'The belief of these truths, I verily think, my
countrymen, is indispensably necessary to your
happiness. I beseech you, therefore, "teach them
diligently unto your children, and talk of them when
you sit in your houses, and when you walk by the
way, and when you lie down and when you rise
up."</p>

<p>'<em>What</em> have these colonies to <em>ask</em>, while they continue
free? or what have they to <em>dread</em>, but insidious
attempts to subvert their freedom? <em>Their
prosperity</em> does not depend on <em>ministerial favours
doled</em> out to particular provinces. <em>They</em> form one
political body, of which <em>each</em> colony is a <em>member</em>.
<em>Their happiness</em> is founded on their constitution;
and is to be promoted by preserving that constitution
in unabated vigour, <em>throughout every part</em>. A
spot, a speck of decay, however small the limb on
which it appears, and however remote it may seem
from the vitals, should be alarming. We have <em>all
the rights</em> requisite for our prosperity. The <em>legal
authority</em> of Great Britain may indeed lay hard restrictions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxiv" id="Page_lxiv">[lxiv]</a></span>
upon us; but, like the spear of Telephus,
it will cure as well as wound. Her unkindness
will instruct and compel us, after some time to discover,
in our <em>industry</em> and <em>frugality</em>, surprising remedies&mdash;<em>if
our rights continue</em> unviolated: for as long
as the <em>products</em> of our <em>labour</em>, and the <em>rewards</em> of our
<em>care</em>, can properly be called <em>our own</em>, so long will it
be worth our while to be <em>industrious</em> and <em>frugal</em>.
But if we plow&mdash;sow&mdash;reap&mdash;gather and thresh&mdash;we
find, that we plow&mdash;sow&mdash;reap&mdash;gather and thresh
<em>for others</em>, whose pleasure is to be the <small>SOLE</small> limitation
<em>how much</em> they shall <em>take</em> and <em>how much</em> they <em>shall
leave</em>, <small>WHY</small> should we repeat the unprofitable toil?
Horses and oxen are content with <em>that portion of
the fruits of their work</em>, which their <em>owners</em> assign to
them, in order to keep them strong enough to raise
successive crops; but even <em>these beasts</em> will not submit
to draw for their masters, until they are <em>subdued</em>
with <em>whips</em> and <em>goads</em>. Let us take care of our rights,
and we <em>therein</em> take care of our <em>property</em>. "<span class="smcap">Slavery
is ever preceded by sleep.</span>" <em>Individuals</em> may be
<em>dependent</em> on ministers if they please. <em>States should
scorn it</em>; and if <em>you</em> are not wanting to yourselves,
you will have a <em>proper regard</em> paid <em>you</em> by <em>those</em>, to
whom if you are not <em>respectable</em>, you will infallibly
be contemptible. But&mdash;<em>if we have already forgot</em>
the <em>reasons</em> that urged us, with unexampled unanimity,
to exert ourselves two years ago&mdash;if <em>our zeal</em>
for the <em>public good</em> is <em>worn out</em> before the <em>homespun
cloaths</em> which it caused us to have made&mdash;if <em>our</em> resolutions
are so faint, as by our present conduct to
<em>condemn</em> our own late <em>successful</em> example&mdash;if <em>we are
not affected</em> by any reverence for the memory of our
ancestors, who transmitted to us that freedom in
which they had been blest&mdash;if <em>we are not animated</em>
by any regard for posterity, to whom, by the most
sacred obligations, we are bound to deliver down
the invaluable inheritance&mdash;<small>THEN</small>, indeed, any <em>minister</em>,
or any <em>tool</em> of a minister, or any <em>creature</em> of a
tool of a minister&mdash;or any <em>lower instrument</em> of <em>administration</em>,
if lower there be, is a <em>personage</em> whom it
may be dangerous to offend.'</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxv" id="Page_lxv">[lxv]</a></span></p>

<p>"In justification of the Letter-writer's loyalty,
and the integrity of his intentions, he declares in a
note:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'If any person shall imagine that he discovers in
these letters the least disaffection towards our
most excellent sovereign, and the parliament of
Great Britain, or the least dislike of the dependence
of these colonies on that kingdom, I beg that such
person will not form any judgment on <em>particular
expressions</em>, but will consider the <em>tenour</em> of all the
letters taken together. In that case, I flatter myself
that every unprejudiced reader will be <em>convinced</em>,
that the true interests of Great Britain are
as dear to me as they ought to be to every good
subject.</p>

<p>'If I am an enthusiast in anything, it is in my
zeal for the <em>perpetual dependance</em> of these colonies
on the mother country.&mdash;A dependance founded on
mutual benefits, the continuance of which can be
secured only by <em>mutual affections</em>. Therefore it is,
that with extreme apprehension I view the smallest
seeds of discontent, which are unwarily scattered
abroad. Fifty or sixty years will make astonishing
alterations in these colonies; and this consideration
should render it the business of Great Britain
more and more to cultivate our good dispositions
toward her: but the misfortune is, that those <em>great
men</em>, who are wrestling for power at home, think
themselves very slightly interested in the prosperity
of their country <em>fifty</em> or <em>sixty</em> years hence; but are
deeply concerned in blowing up a popular clamour
for supposed <em>immediate advantages</em>.</p>

<p>'For my part, I regard Great Britain as a <em>bulwark</em>
happily fixed between these colonies and the
powerful nations of Europe. That kingdom is
our advanced post or fortification, <em>which remaining
safe</em>, we under its protection enjoying peace, may
diffuse the blessings of religion, science, and liberty,
through remote wildernesses. It is, therefore,
incontestably our <em>duty</em> and our <em>interest</em> to support
the strength of Great Britain. When, confiding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxvi" id="Page_lxvi">[lxvi]</a></span>
in that strength, she begins to forget from whence
it arose, it will be an easy thing to shew the source.
She may readily be reminded of the loud alarm
spread among her merchants and tradesmen, by
the universal association of these colonies, at the
time of the <em>stamp-act</em>, not to import any of her
<small>MANUFACTURES</small>. In the year 1718, the Russians
and Swedes entered into an agreement, not to suffer
Great Britain to export any naval stores from
their dominions, but in Russian or Swedish ships,
and at their own prices. Great Britain was distressed.
<em>Pitch</em> and <em>tar</em> rose to <em>three pounds</em> a barrel.
At length she thought of getting these articles from
the colonies; and the attempt succeeding, they fell
down to fifteen shillings. In the year 1756, Great
Britain was threatened with an invasion: An easterly
wind blowing for six weeks, she could not <small>MAN</small>
her fleet; and the whole nation was thrown into
the utmost consternation. The wind changed.
The American ships arrived. The fleet sailed in
ten or fifteen days. There are some other reflections
on this subject worthy of the most deliberate
attention of the British parliament; but they are
of such a nature that I do not chuse to mention
them publicly. I thought I discharged my duty to
my country, by taking the liberty, in the year 1765,
while the <em>stamp-act</em> was in suspence, of writing my
sentiments to a man of the greatest influence at
home, who afterwards distinguished himself by espousing
our cause in the debates concerning the repeal
of that act.'</p></blockquote>

<p>"When we review a performance well written,
and founded upon laudable principles, if we do
not restrain ourselves to a general approbation,
which may be given in few words, the article will
unavoidably contain more from the author of it,
than from ourselves; this, if any excuse is needful
for enabling our Readers, in some measure, to
judge for themselves, is pleaded as an apology for
our copious extracts from these excellent letters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxvii" id="Page_lxvii">[lxvii]</a></span>
To conclude; if <em>reason</em> is to decide between us and
our colonies, in the affairs here controverted, our
Author, whose name the advertisements inform
us is Dickenson,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> will not perhaps easily meet with
a satisfactory refutation."</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_I" id="LETTER_I">LETTER I.</a></h2>


<p><i>My Dear Countrymen</i>,</p>

<p>I am a farmer, settled after a variety
of fortunes, near the banks, of the river
<i>Delaware</i>, in the province of <i>Pennsylvania</i>.
I received a liberal education, and have
been engaged in the busy scenes of life: But
am now convinced, that a man may be as
happy without bustle, as with it. My farm
is small, my servants are few, and good;
I have a little money at interest; I wish for
no more: my employment in my own affairs
is easy; and with a contented grateful
mind, I am compleating the number of
days allotted to me by divine goodness.</p>

<p>Being master of my time, I spend a good
deal of it in a library, which I think the
most valuable part of my small estate; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
being acquainted with two or three gentlemen
of abilities and learning, who honour
me with their friendship, I believe I have
acquired a greater share of knowledge in
history, and the laws and constitution of my
country, than is generally attained by men
of my class, many of them not being so
fortunate as I have been in the opportunities
of getting information.</p>

<p>From infancy I was taught to love humanity
and liberty. Inquiry and experience
have since confirmed my reverence for the
lessons then given me, by convincing me
more fully of their truth and excellence.
Benevolence towards mankind excites wishes
for their welfare, and such wishes endear the
means of fulfilling them. Those can be
found in liberty alone, and therefore her
sacred cause ought to be espoused by every
man, on every occasion, to the utmost of
his power: as a charitable but poor person
does not withhold his <em>mite</em>, because he
cannot relieve <em>all</em> the distresses of the miserable,
so let not any honest man suppress
his sentiments concerning freedom, however
small their influence is likely to be. Perhaps
he may "<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>touch some wheel" that
will have an effect greater than he expects.</p>

<p>These being my sentiments, I am encouraged
to offer to you, my countrymen, my
thoughts on some late transactions, that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
my opinion are of the utmost importance to
you. Conscious of my defects, I have waited
some time, in expectation of seeing the
subject treated by persons much better qualified
for the task; but being therein disappointed,
and apprehensive that longer delays
will be injurious, I venture at length to request
the attention of the public, praying
only for one thing,&mdash;that is that these lines
may be <em>read</em> with the same zeal for the happiness
of British America, with which they
were <em>wrote</em>.</p>

<p>With a good deal of surprise I have observed,
that little notice has been taken of an
act of parliament, as injurious in its principle
to the liberties of these colonies, as the
<span class="smcap">Stamp-act</span> was: I mean the act for suspending
the legislation of New-York.</p>

<p>The assembly of that government complied
with a former act of parliament, requiring
certain provisions to be made for
the troops in America, in every particular,
I think, except the articles of salt, pepper,
and vinegar. In my opinion they acted
imprudently, considering all circumstances,
in not complying so far, as would have
given satisfaction, as several colonies did:
but my dislike of their conduct in that
instance, has not blinded me so much, that
I cannot plainly perceive, that they have
been punished in a manner pernicious to
American freedom, and justly alarming to
all the colonies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>If the <span class="smcap">British Parliament</span> has a
legal authority to order, that we shall furnish
a single article for the troops here, and
to compel obedience to that order; they
have the same right to order us to supply
those troops with arms, cloaths, and every
necessary, and to compel obedience to that
order also; in short, to lay <em>any burdens</em>
they please upon us. What is this but
<em>taxing</em> us at a <em>certain sum</em>, and leaving to
us only the <em>manner</em> of raising it? How is
this mode more tolerable than the <span class="smcap">Stamp
Act</span>? Would that act have appeared more
pleasing to <span class="smcap">Americans</span>, if being ordered
thereby to raise the sum total of the taxes,
the mighty privilege had been left to them,
of saying how much should be paid for
an instrument of writing on paper, and
how much for another on parchment?</p>

<p>An act of parliament commanding us to
do a certain thing, if it has any validity,
is a tax upon us for the expence that accrues
in complying with it, and for this reason, I
believe, every colony on the continent, that
chose to give a mark of their respect for
<span class="smcap">Great-Britain</span>, in complying with the
act relating to the troops, cautiously avoided
the mention of that act, lest their conduct
should be attributed to its supposed obligation.</p>

<p>The matter being thus stated, the assembly
of <i>New-York</i> either had, or had not a right
to refuse submission to that act. If they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
had, and I imagine no <span class="smcap">American</span> will say,
they had not, then the parliament had no
<em>right</em> to compel them to execute it.&mdash;If they
had not <em>that right</em>, they had <em>no right</em> to
punish them for not executing it; and therefore
had <em>no right</em> to suspend their legislation,
which is a punishment. In fact, if the
people of <i>New-York</i> cannot be legally taxed
but by their own representatives, they cannot
be legally deprived of the privileges of
making laws, only for insisting on that exclusive
privilege of taxation. If they may
be legally deprived in such a case of the
privilege of making laws, why may they
not, with equal reason, be deprived of every
other privilege? Or why may not every
colony be treated in the same manner,
when any of them shall dare to deny their
assent to any impositions that shall be directed?
Or what signifies the repeal of the
<span class="smcap">Stamp-Act</span>, if these colonies are to lose
their <em>other</em> privileges, by not tamely surrendering
that of <em>taxation</em>?</p>

<p>There is one consideration arising from this
suspicion, which is not generally attended to,
but shews its importance very clearly. It was
not <em>necessary</em> that this suspension should be
caused by an act of parliament. The crown
might have restrained the governor of <i>New-York</i>,
even from calling the assembly together,
by its prerogative in the royal governments.
This step, I suppose, would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
been taken, if the conduct of the assembly of
<i>New-York</i>, had been regarded as an act of
disobedience <em>to the crown alone</em>: but it is
regarded as an act of "disobedience to
the authority of the <span class="smcap">British Legislature</span>."
This gives the suspension a
consequence vastly more affecting. It is a
parliamentary assertion of the <em>supreme authority</em>
of the <i>British legislature</i> over these colonies
in <em>the part of taxation</em>; and is intended
to <small>COMPEL</small> <i>New-York</i> unto a submission
to that authority. It seems therefore to me
as much a violation of the liberty of the people
of that province, and consequently of all
these colonies, as if the parliament had sent a
number of regiments to be quartered upon
them till they should comply. For it is evident,
that the suspension is meant as a compulsion;
and the <em>method</em> of compelling is totally
indifferent. It is indeed probable, that the
sight of red coats, and the beating of drums
would have been most alarming, because
people are generally more influenced by their
eyes and ears than by their reason: But whoever
seriously considers the matter, must
perceive, that a dreadful stroke is aimed at
the liberty of these colonies: For the cause
of <em>one</em> is the cause of <em>all</em>. If the parliament
may lawfully deprive <i>New-York</i> of any of
its rights, it may deprive any, or all the other
colonies of their rights; and nothing
can possibly so much encourage such attempts,
as a mutual inattention to the interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
of each other. <em>To divide, and thus to
destroy</em>, is the first political maxim in attacking
those who are powerful by their union.
He certainly is not a wise man, who folds his
arms and reposeth himself at home, seeing
with unconcern the flames that have invaded
his neighbour's house, without any endeavours
to extinguish them. When Mr. <em>Hampden's</em>
ship-money cause, for three shillings
and four-pence, was tried, all the people of
<i>England</i>, with anxious expectation, interested
themselves in the important decision; and
when the slightest point touching the freedom
of a single colony is agitated, I earnestly
wish, that all the rest may with equal ardour
support their sister. Very much may
be said on this subject, but I hope, more at
present is unnecessary.</p>

<p>With concern I have observed that two
assemblies of this province have sat and adjourned,
without taking any notice of this
act. It may perhaps be asked, what would
have been proper for them to do? I am by
no means fond of inflammatory measures. I
detest them.&mdash;&mdash;I should be sorry that any
thing should be done which might justly displease
our sovereign or our mother-country.
But a firm, modest exertion of a free spirit,
should never be wanting on public occasions.
It appears to me, that it would have been
sufficient for the assembly, to have ordered
our agents to represent to the King's ministers,
their sense of the suspending act, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
to pray for its repeal. Thus we should have
borne our testimony against it; and might
therefore reasonably expect that on a like
occasion, we might receive the same assistance
from the other colonies.</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_II" id="LETTER_II">LETTER II.</a></h2>


<p><i>Beloved Countrymen</i>,</p>

<p>There is another late act of parliament,
which seems to me to be as
destructive to the liberty of these colonies,
as that inserted in my last letter; that is,
the act for granting the duties on paper,
glass, &amp;c. It appears to me to be unconstitutional.</p>

<p>The parliament unquestionably possesses a
legal authority to <em>regulate</em> the trade of
<i>Great-Britain</i>, and all its colonies. Such
an authority is essential to the relation between
a mother country and its colonies;
and necessary for the common good of all.
He, who considers these provinces as states
distinct from the <i>British Empire</i>, has very
slender notions of <em>justice</em> or of <em>their interests</em>.
We are but parts of <em>a whole</em>; and therefore
there must exist a power somewhere, to
preside, and preserve the connection in due
order. This power is lodged in the parliament;
and we are as much dependant on
<i>Great-Britain</i>, as a perfectly free people can
be on another.</p>

<p>I have looked over every <em>statute</em> relating
to these colonies, from their first settlement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
to this time; and I find every one of them
founded on this principle, till the <span class="smcap">Stamp-act</span>
administration<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>. <em>All before</em> are calculated
to preserve or promote a mutually
beneficial intercourse between the
several constituent parts of the empire;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
and though many of them imposed duties
on trade, yet those duties were always
imposed <em>with design</em> to restrain the commerce
of one part, that was injurious to another,
and thus to promote the general welfare.
The raising a revenue thereby was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
never intended. Thus, the king by his judges
in his courts of justice, imposes fines, which
all together amount to a considerable sum,
and contribute to the support of government:
but this is merely a consequence arising
from restrictions, which only meant to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
keep peace, and prevent confusion; and surely
a man would argue very loosely, who
should conclude from hence, that the King
has a right to levy money in general upon
his subjects; Never did the <i>British parliament</i>,
till the period abovementioned, think of imposing
duties in America <small>FOR THE PURPOSE
OF RAISING A REVENUE</small>. Mr. <i>Greenville's</i>
sagacity first introduced this language,
in the preamble to the 4th of Geo. III. Ch.
15, which has these words&mdash;"And whereas
it is just and necessary that a <span class="smcap">revenue be
raised in your Majesty's said dominions
in America</span>, <em>for defraying the expences
of defending, protecting and securing
the same</em>: We your Majesty's most dutiful
and loyal subjects, <span class="smcap">the commons of
Great Britain</span>, in parliament assembled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
being desirous to make some provision in
the present session of parliament, towards
raising the said revenue in America, have
resolved to give and grant unto your Majesty
the several rates and duties herein after
mentioned," &amp;c.</p>

<p>A few months after came the <i>Stamp-act</i>,
which reciting this, proceeds in the same
strange mode of expression, thus&mdash;"And
whereas it is just and necessary, that provision
be made <span class="smcap">for raising a further revenue
within your majesty's dominions in America</span>,
towards defraying the said expences,
we your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects,
the <span class="smcap">Commons of Great-Britain</span>,
&amp;c. <small>GIVE</small> and <small>GRANT</small>," &amp;c. as before.</p>

<p>The last act, granting duties upon paper,
&amp;c. carefully pursues these modern precedents.
The preamble is, "Whereas it is
expedient that a revenue should be raised in
your Majesty's dominions in America, for
making a more certain and adequate provision
for the defraying the charge of the
administration of justice, and the support of
civil government in such provinces, where
it shall be found necessary; and towards
the further defraying the expences of defending,
protecting and securing the said dominions,
we your Majesty's most dutiful and
loyal subjects, the <span class="smcap">Commons of Great-Britain</span>,
&amp;c. give and grant," &amp;c. as before.</p>

<p>Here we may observe an authority <em>expressly</em>
claimed to impose duties on these colonies;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
not for the regulation of trade; not for
the preservation or promotion of a mutually
beneficial intercourse between the several
constituent parts of the empire, heretofore
the <em>sole objects</em> of parliamentary institutions;
<em>but for the single purpose of levying money
upon us</em>.</p>

<p>This I call an<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> innovation; and a most
dangerous innovation. It may perhaps be
objected, that <i>Great-Britain</i> has a right to
lay what duties she pleases upon her<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> exports,
and it makes no difference to us,
whether they are paid here or there.</p>

<p>To this I answer. These colonies require
many things for their use, which the laws
of <i>Great-Britain</i> prohibit them from getting
any where but from her. Such are paper
and glass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>That we may be legally bound to pay any
<em>general</em> duties on these commodities, relative
to the regulation of trade, is granted; but
we being <em>obliged by her laws</em> to take them
from Great Britain, any <em>special</em> duties imposed
on their exportation <em>to us only, with
intention to raise a revenue from us only</em>, are
as much <em>taxes</em> upon us, as those imposed by
the <i>Stamp-act</i>.</p>

<p>What is the difference in <em>substance</em> and
<em>right</em>, whether the same sum is raised upon
us by the rates mentioned in the Stamp-act,
on the <em>use</em> of the paper, or by these duties, on
the <em>importation</em> of it. It is nothing but the
edition of a former book, with a new title
page.</p>

<p>Suppose the duties were made payable in
<i>Great-Britain</i>?</p>

<p>It signifies nothing to us, whether they
are to be paid here or there. Had the
<i>Stamp-act</i> directed, that all the paper should
be landed in <i>Florida</i>, and the duties paid
there, before it was brought to the <i>British
Colonies</i>, would the act have raised less money
upon us, or have been less destructive
of our rights? By no means: For as we
were under a necessity of using the paper,
we should have been under the necessity of
paying the duties. Thus, in the present
case, a like <em>necessity</em> will subject us, if this
act continues in force, to the payment of the
duties now imposed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Why was the <i>Stamp-act</i> then so pernicious
to freedom? It did not enact, that every
man in the colonies <em>should</em> buy a certain
quantity of paper&mdash;No: It only directed,
that no instrument of writing should be
valid in law, if not made on stamp paper,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>The makers of that act knew full well,
that the confusions that would arise upon
the disuse of writings would <small>COMPEL</small> the
colonies to use the stamp paper, and
therefore to pay the taxes imposed. For
this reason the <i>Stamp-act</i> was said to be a
law <small>THAT WOULD EXECUTE ITSELF</small>. For the
very same reason, the last act of parliament,
if it is granted to have any force here, will
execute itself, and will be attended with the
very same consequences to <i>American Liberty</i>.</p>

<p>Some persons perhaps may say, that this
act lays us under no necessity to pay the duties
imposed, because we may ourselves manufacture
the articles on which they are
laid: whereas by the Stamp-act no instrument
of writing could be good, unless made
on British paper, and that too stampt.</p>

<p>Such an objection amounts to no more
than this, that the injury resulting to these
colonies, from the total disuse of British paper
and glass, will not be <em>so afflicting</em> as that
which would have resulted from the total
disuse of writing among them; for by that
means even the stamp-act might have been
eluded. Why then was it universally detested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
by them as slavery itself? Because it
presented to these devoted provinces nothing
but a choice of calamities, imbittered by
indignities, each of which it was unworthy
of freemen to bear. But is no injury a violation
of right but the <em>greatest</em> injury? If
the eluding the payment of the duties imposed
by the stamp-act, would have subjected
us to a more dreadful inconvenience, than
the eluding the payment of those imposed by
the late act; does it therefore follow, that
the last is no violation of our rights, though
it is calculated for the same purpose that the
other was, that is, <em>to raise money upon us</em>,
<small>WITHOUT OUR CONSENT</small>?</p>

<p>This would be making <em>right</em> to consist,
not in an exemption from <em>injury</em>, but from
a certain <em>degree of injury</em>.</p>

<p>But the objectors may further say, that
we shall sustain no injury at all by the disuse
of British paper and glass. We might not,
if we could make as much as we want.
But can any man, acquainted with America,
believe this possible? I am told there
are but two or three <em>glass-houses</em> on this
continent, and but very few <em>paper-mills</em>;
and suppose more should be erected, a long
course of years must elapse, before they can
be brought to perfection. This continent
is a country of planters, farmers, and fishermen;
not of manufacturers. The difficulty
of establishing particular manufactures
in such a country, is almost insuperable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
for one manufacture is connected with others
in such a manner, that it may be said
to be impossible to establish one or two,
without establishing several others. The
experience of many nations may convince
us of this truth.</p>

<p>Inexpressible therefore must be our distresses
in evading the late acts, by the disuse
of British paper and glass. Nor will this
be the extent of our misfortunes, if we admit
the legality of that act.</p>

<p><i>Great-Britain</i> has prohibited the manufacturing
iron and steel in these colonies,
without any objection being made to her
right of doing it. The like right she must
have to prohibit any other manufacture among
us. Thus she is possessed of an undisputed
<em>precedent</em> on that point. This authority,
she will say, is founded on the <em>original
intention</em> of settling these colonies; that is,
that she should manufacture for them, and
that they should supply her with materials.
The <em>equity</em> of this policy, she will also say,
has been universally acknowledged by the
colonies, who never have made the least objection
to statutes for that purpose; and will
further appear by the <em>mutual benefits</em> flowing
from this usage, ever since the settlement of
these colonies.</p>

<p>Our great advocate, Mr. <span class="smcap">Pitt</span>, in his
speeches on the debate concerning the repeal
of the <i>Stamp-act</i>, acknowledged, that Great-Britain
could restrain our manufactures. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
words are these&mdash;"This kingdom, as the
supreme governing and legislative power,
has <em>always</em> bound the colonies by her regulations
and <em>restrictions</em> in trade, in navigation,
in <em>manufactures</em>&mdash;&mdash;in every thing, <em>except
that of taking their money out of their
pockets</em>, <small>WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT</small>." Again
he says, "We may bind their trade,
<small>CONFINE THEIR MANUFACTURES</small>, and
exercise every power whatever, except that
of taking money out of their pockets, <small>WITHOUT
THEIR CONSENT</small>."</p>

<p>Here then, let my countrymen, <small>ROUSE</small>
yourselves, and behold the ruin hanging over
their heads. If they ONCE admit, that
Great-Britain may lay duties upon her exportations
to us, <em>for the purpose of levying
money on us only</em>, she then will have nothing
to do, but to lay those duties on the articles
which she prohibits us to manufacture&mdash;and
the tragedy of American liberty is finished.
We have been prohibited from procuring
manufactures, in all cases, any where but
from Great-Britain, (excepting linens, which
we are permitted to import directly from
Ireland). We have been prohibited, in some
cases, from manufacturing for ourselves;
We are therefore exactly in the situation of a
city besieged, which is surrounded by the
works of the besiegers in every part <em>but one</em>.
If <em>that</em> is closed up, no step can be taken, <em>but
to surrender at discretion</em>. If Great-Britain
can order us to come to her for necessaries we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
want, and can order us to pay what taxes
she pleases before we take them away, or
when we have them here, we are as abject
slaves, as France and Poland can shew in
wooden shoes, and with uncombed hair.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Perhaps the nature of the necessities of the
dependant states, caused by the policy of a
governing one, for her own benefit, may
be elucidated by a fact mentioned in history.
When the Carthaginians were possessed of
the island of Sardinia, they made a decree,
that the Sardinians should not get corn,
any other way than from the Carthaginians.
Then, by imposing any duties they would,
they drained from the miserable Sardinians
any sums they pleased; and whenever
that oppressed people made the least movement
to assert their liberty, their tyrants
starved them to death or submission. This
may be called the most perfect kind of political
necessity.</p>

<p>From what has been said, I think this uncontrovertible
conclusion may be deduced,
that when a ruling state obliges a dependant
state to take certain commodities from her
alone, it is implied in the nature of that obligation;
and is essentially requisite to give it
the least degree of justice; and is inseparably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
united with it, in order to preserve any share
of freedom to the dependant state; that those
commodities should never be loaded with
duties for the sole purpose of levying money
on the dependant state.</p>

<p>The place of paying the duties imposed
by the late act, appears to me therefore to be
totally immaterial. The single question is,
whether the parliament can legally impose
duties to be paid <em>by the people of these colonies
only</em> <span class="smcap">for the sole purpose of raising
a revenue</span>, <em>on commodities which she
obliges us to take from her alone</em>; or, in other
words, whether the parliament can legally
take money out of our pockets, without
our consent. If they can, our boasted liberty
is but</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_III" id="LETTER_III">LETTER III.</a></h2>


<p><i>Beloved Countrymen</i>,</p>

<p>I rejoice to find, that my two former
letters to you, have been generally received
with so much favour by such of you
whose sentiments I have had an opportunity
of knowing. Could you look into my heart,
you would instantly perceive an ardent affection
for your persons, a zealous attachment
to your interests, a lively resentment of every
insult and injury offered to your honour
or happiness, and an inflexible resolution to
assert your rights, to the utmost of my
weak power, to be the only motives that
have engaged me to address you.</p>

<p>I am no further concerned in any thing
affecting America, than any one of you, and
when liberty leaves it I can quit it much
more conveniently than most of you: but
while divine providence, that gave me existence
in a land of freedom, permits my
head to think, my lips to speak, and my
hand to move, I shall so highly and gratefully
value the blessing received, as to take
care that my silence and inactivity shall not
give my implied assent to any act degrading
my brethren and myself from the birthright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
wherewith heaven itself "<em>hath made us
free</em>.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>"</p>

<p>Sorry I am to learn, that there are some
few persons, shake their heads with solemn
motion, and pretend to wonder what can
be the meaning of these letters. "Great-Britain,
they say, is too powerful to contend
with; she is determined to oppress us;
it is in vain to speak of right on one side,
when there is power on the other; when we
are strong enough to resist, we shall attempt
it; but now we are not strong enough, and
therefore we had better be quiet; it signifies
nothing to convince us that our rights
are invaded, when we cannot defend them,
and if we should get into riots and tumults
about the late act, it will only draw down
heavier displeasure upon us."</p>

<p>What can such men design? What do
their grave observations amount to, but this&mdash;"that
these colonies, totally regardless
of their liberties, should commit them,
with humble resignation, to <em>chance</em>, <em>time</em>,
and the tender mercies of <em>ministers</em>."</p>

<p>Are these men ignorant, that usurpations,
which might have been successfully opposed
at first, acquire strength by continuance,
and thus become irresistible? Do they condemn
the conduct of these colonies, concerning
the <i>Stamp-act</i>? Or have they forgot its
successful issue? Ought the colonies at that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
time, instead of acting as they did, to have
trusted for relief, to the fortuitous events of
futurity? If it is needless "to speak of
rights" now, it was as needless then. If the
behaviour of the colonies was prudent and
glorious then, and successful too; it will be
equally prudent and glorious to act in the
same manner now, if our rights are equally
invaded, and may be as successful.
Therefore it becomes necessary to enquire,
whether "our rights <em>are</em> invaded." To
talk of "defending" them, as if they could
be no otherwise "defended" than by arms,
is as much out of the way, as if a man
having a choice of several roads to reach his
journey's end, should prefer the worst, for
no other reason, than because it is the worst.</p>

<p>As to "riots and tumults," the gentlemen
who are so apprehensive of them, are
much mistaken, if they think, that grievances
cannot be redressed without such assistance.</p>

<p>I will now tell the gentlemen, what is
"the meaning of these letters." The meaning
of them is, to convince the people of
these colonies, that they are at this moment
exposed to the most imminent dangers; and
to persuade them immediately, vigourously,
and unanimously, to exert themselves, in
the most firm, but most peaceable manner
for obtaining relief.</p>

<p>The cause of liberty is a cause of too
much dignity, to be sullied by turbulence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
and tumult. It ought to be maintained in a
manner suitable to her nature. Those who
engage in it, should breathe a sedate, yet
fervent spirit, animating them to actions
of prudence, justice, modesty, bravery, humanity,
and magnanimity.</p>

<p>To such a wonderful degree were the antient
<i>Spartans</i>, as brave and as free a people
as ever existed, inspired by this happy temperature
of soul, that rejecting even in their
battles the use of trumpets, and other instruments
for exciting heat and rage, they marched
up to scenes of havock and horror, with
the sound of flutes, to the tunes of which
their steps kept pace&mdash;"exhibiting, as <i>Plutarch</i>
says, at once a terrible and delightful
sight, and proceeding with a deliberate
valour, full of hope and good assurance,
as if some divinity had insensibly assisted
them."</p>

<p>I hope, my dear countrymen, that you
will in every colony be upon your guard against
those who may at any time endeavour
to stir you up, under pretences of patriotism,
to any measures disrespectful to our sovereign
and our mother country. Hot, rash, disorderly
proceedings, injure the reputation of a
people as to wisdom, valour and virtue,
without procuring them the least benefit. I
pray God, that he may be pleased to inspire
you and your posterity to the latest ages
with that spirit, of which I have an idea, but
find a difficulty to express: to express in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the best manner I can, I mean a spirit that
shall so guide you, that it will be impossible
to determine, whether an <i>American</i>'s character
is most distinguishable for his loyalty
to his sovereign, his duty to his mother country,
his love of freedom, or his affection for
his native soil.</p>

<p>Every government, at some time or other,
falls into wrong measures; these may proceed
from mistake or passion.&mdash;&mdash;But every
such measure does not dissolve the obligation
between the governors and the governed;
the mistake may be corrected; the passion
may pass over.</p>

<p>It is the duty of the governed, to endeavour
to rectify the mistake, and appease the
passion. They have not at first any other
right, than to represent their grievances, and
to pray for redress, unless an emergency is
so pressing, as not to allow time for receiving
an answer to their applications which
rarely happens. If their applications are disregarded,
then that kind of opposition becomes
justifiable, which can be made without
breaking the laws, or disturbing the public
peace. This consists in the prevention of
the oppressors reaping advantage from their
oppressions, and not in their punishment. For
experience may teach them what reason did
not; and harsh methods, cannot be proper,
till milder ones have failed.</p>

<p>If at length it becomes undoubted, that
an inveterate resolution is formed to annihilate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the liberties of the governed, the English
history affords frequent examples of resistance
by force. What particular circumstances will
in any future case justify such resistance, can
never be ascertained till they happen. Perhaps
it may be allowable to say, generally,
that it never can be justifiable, until the people
are <small>FULLY CONVINCED</small>, that any further
submission will be destructive to their
happiness.</p>

<p>When the appeal is made to the sword,
highly probable it is, that the punishment
will exceed the offence; and the calamities
attending on war out weigh those preceding
it. These considerations of justice and prudence,
will always have great influence with
good and wise men.</p>

<p>To these reflections on this subject, it remains
to be added, and ought for ever to be
remembred; that resistance in the case of
colonies against their mother country, is extremely
different from the resistance of a
people against their prince. A nation may
change their King or race of Kings, and retain
their antient form of government, be
gainers by changing. Thus Great-Britain,
under the illustrious house of Brunswick, a
house that seems to flourish for the happiness
of mankind, has found a felicity, unknown
in the reigns of the Stuarts. But if once we
are separated from our mother country, what
new form of government shall we accept, or
when shall we find another Britain to supply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
our loss? Torn from the body to which we
are united by religion, liberty, laws, affections,
relations, language, and commerce, we
must bleed at every vein.</p>

<p>In truth, the prosperity of these provinces
is founded in their dependance on Great-Britain;
and when she returns to "her old
good humour, and old good nature," as
Lord Clerendon expresses it, I hope they
will always esteem it their duty and interest,
as it most certainly will be, to promote her
welfare by all the means in their power.</p>

<p>We cannot act with too much caution
in our disputes. Anger produces anger;
and differences that might be accommodated
by kind and respectful behaviour, may by
imprudence be changed to an incurable rage.</p>

<p>In quarrels between countries, as well as
in those between individuals, when they have
risen to a certain heighth, the first cause of
dissention is no longer remembred, the minds
of the parties being wholly engaged in recollecting
and resenting the mutual expressions
of their dislike. When feuds have
reached that fatal point, all considerations
of reason and equity vanish; and a blind
fury governs, or rather confounds all things.
A people no longer regards their interest,
but the gratification of their wrath. The
sway of the Cleon's,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and Clodius's, the designing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
and detestable flatters of the prevailing
passion, becomes confirmed.</p>

<p>Wise and good men in vain oppose the
storm, and may think themselves fortunate,
if, endeavouring to preserve their ungrateful
fellow citizens, they do not ruin themselves.
Their prudence will be called baseness; their
moderation, guilt; and if their virtue does
not lead them to destruction, as that of
many other great and excellent persons has
done, they may survive, to receive from their
expiring country, the mournful glory of her
acknowledgment, that their councils, if regarded,
would have saved her.</p>

<p>The constitutional modes of obtaining relief,
are those which I would wish to see
pursued on the present occasion, that is, by
petitioning of our assemblies, or, where they
are not permitted to meet, of the people
to the powers that can afford us relief.</p>

<p>We have an excellent prince, in whose
good dispositions towards us we may confide.
We have a generous, sensible, and humane
nation, to whom we may apply. They
may be deceived: they may, by artful men,
be provoked to anger against us; but I cannot
yet believe they will be cruel or unjust;
or that their anger will be implacable. Let
us behave like dutiful children, who have
received unmerited blows from a beloved
parent. Let us complain to our parents;
but let our complaints speak at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
time, the language of affliction and veneration.</p>

<p>If, however, it shall happen by an unfortunate
course of affairs, that our applications
to his Majesty and the parliament for the
redress, prove ineffectual, let us then take
another step, by withholding from Great-Britain,
all the advantages she has been used
to receive from us. Then let us try, if our
ingenuity, industry, and frugality, will not
give weight to our remonstrances. Let us
all be united with one spirit in one cause.
Let us invent; let us work; let us save; let
us at the same time, keep up our claims, and
unceasingly repeat our complaints; but
above all, let us implore the protection of
that infinite good and gracious Being, "by
whom kings reign and princes decree
justice."</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_IV" id="LETTER_IV">LETTER IV.</a></h2>


<p><i>Beloved Countrymen</i>,</p>

<p>An objection, I hear, has been made
against what I offer in my second letter,
which I would willingly clear up before
I proceed. "There is," say these objectors
"a material difference between the
Stamp-act and the late act for laying a
duty on paper, &amp;c. that justifies the conduct
of those who opposed the former,
and yet are willing to submit to the latter.
The duties imposed by the Stamp-act,
were internal taxes, but the present
are external, which therefore the parliament
may have a right to impose."&mdash;&mdash;To
this I answer, with a total denial of the
power of parliament to lay upon these colonies
any tax whatever.</p>

<p>This point being so important to this and
to all succeeding generations, I wish to be
clearly understood.</p>

<p>To the word "Tax," I annex that
meaning which the constitution and history
of England require to be annexed to it;
that it is, an imposition on the subject for
the sole purpose of levying money.</p>

<p>In the early ages of our monarchy, the
services rendered to the crown, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
general good, were personal;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> but in progress
of time, such institutions being found
inconvenient, certain gifts and grants of
their own property were made by the people,
under the several names of aids, tallages,
talks, taxes, subsidies, &amp;c. These
were made as may be collected even from
the names for public service, "upon need
and necessity,"<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> all these sums were levied
upon the people by virtue of their voluntary
gift.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> The design of them was to support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the national honour and interest. Some of
those grants comprehended duties arising
from trade, being imports on merchandizes.
These Chief Justice Coke classes "under
subsides"<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and "parliamentary aids."
They are also called "customs." But
whatever the name was, they were always
considered as gifts of the people to the
crown, to be employed for public uses.</p>

<p>Commerce was at a low ebb, and most
surprising instances may be produced, how
little it was attended to, for a succession of
ages. The terms that have been mentioned,
and among the rest that of "tax," had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
obtained a national, parliamentary meaning,
drawn from the principles of the constitution,
long before any Englishmen thought
of regulations of trade "by imposing
duties."</p>

<p>Whenever we speak of taxes among
Englishmen, let us therefore speak of them
with reference to the intentions with which,
and the principles on which they have been
established. This will give certainty to our
expression, and safety to our conduct: but
if when we have in view the liberty of
these colonies, and the influence of "taxes"
laid without our consent, we proceed in any
other course, we pursue a Juno<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> indeed,
but shall only catch a cloud.</p>

<p>In the national parliamentary sense insisted
on, the word "tax"<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> was certainly
understood by the congress at New-York,
whose resolves may be said to form the American
"bill of rights." I am satisfied that
the congress was of opinion, that no impositions
could be legally laid on the people of
these colonies for the purpose of levying
money, but by themselves or their representatives.</p>

<p>The third, fourth, fifth, and sixth resolves
are thus expressed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>III. "That it is inseparably essential to
the freedom of a people and the undoubted
right of Englishmen, that no tax be imposed
on them, but with their own consent, given
personally or by their representatives."</p>

<p>IV. "That the people of the colonies
are not, and from their local circumstances
cannot be represented in the House of Commons,
in Great-Britain."</p>

<p>V. "That the only representatives of the
people of the colonies, are the persons chosen
therein by themselves; and that no
taxes ever have been, or can be constitutionally
imposed on them, but by their respective
legislatures."</p>

<p>VI. "That all supplies to the crown
being free gifts of the people, it is unreasonable
and inconsistent with the principles
and spirit of the British constitution, for the
people of Great-Britain to grant to his Majesty
the property of the colonies."</p>

<p>Here is no distinction made, between internal
and external taxes. It is evident
from the short reasoning thrown into these
resolves that every imposition "to grant to
his Majesty the property of the colonies,"
was thought a "tax;" and that every
such imposition if laid any other way "but
with their consent, given personally, or by
their representatives;" was not only "unreasonable,
and inconsistent with the principles
and spirit of the British constitution,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
but destructive "to the freedom
of a people."</p>

<p>This language is clear and important. A
"tax" means an imposition to raise money.
Such persons therefore as speak of internal
and external "taxes," I pray may pardon
me, if I object to that expression as applied to
the privileges and interests of these colonies.
There may be external and internal impositions,
founded on different principles, and having
different tendencies; every "tax" being
an imposition, tho' every imposition is
not a "tax." But all "taxes" are founded
on the same principle, and have the same
tendency.</p>

<p>"External impositions for the regulation
of our trade, do not grant to his Majesty
the property of the colonies." They only
prevent the colonies acquiring property in
things not necessary, and in a manner judged
to be injurious to the welfare of the whole
empire. But the last statute respecting us,
"grants to his Majesty the property of these
colonies," by laying duties on manufactures
of Great-Britain, which they must
take, and which he settled them, in order
that they should take.</p>

<p>What<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> "tax" can be more "internal"
than this? Here is money drawn without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
their consent from a society, who have constantly
enjoyed a constitutional mode of raising
all money among themselves. The
payment of this tax they have no possible
method of avoiding, as they cannot do without
the commodities on which it is laid, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
they cannot manufacture these commodities
themselves; besides, if this unhappy country
should be so lucky as to elude this act, by
getting parchment enough to use in the
place of paper, or reviving the antient
method of writing on wax and bark, and
by inventing something to serve instead of
glass, her ingenuity would stand her in little
stead; for then the parliament would have
nothing to do, but to prohibit manufactures,
or to lay a tax on hats and woollen
cloths, which they have already prohibited
the colonies from supplying each other with;
or on instruments and tools of steel and iron,
which they have prohibited the provincials<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
from manufacturing at all<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> And then
what little gold and silver they have, must
be torn from their hands, or they will not
be able in a short time, to get an ax<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> for
cutting their firewood, nor a plough for
raising their food.&mdash;In what respect therefore,
I beg leave to ask, is the late act preferable
to the Stamp-act, or more consistent
with the liberties of the colonies? "I regard
them both with equal apprehension,
and think they ought to be in the same
manner opposed."</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_V" id="LETTER_V">LETTER V.</a></h2>


<p><i>Beloved Countrymen</i>,</p>

<p>Perhaps the objection to the late act,
imposing duties upon paper, &amp;c. might
have been safely rested on the arguments
drawn from the universal conduct of parliaments
and ministers, from the first existence
of these colonies, to the administration of
Mr. Grenville.</p>

<p>What but the indisputable, the acknowledged
exclusive right of the colonies to tax
themselves, could be the reason, that in this
long period of more than one hundred and
fifty years, no statute was ever passed for the
sole purpose of raising a revenue on the colonies?
And how clear, how cogent must
that reason be, to which every parliament
and every minister, for so long a time submitted,
without a single attempt to innovate?</p>

<p>England in part of that course of years,
and Great Britain, in other parts, was engaged
in fierce and expensive wars; troubled
with some tumultuous and bold parliaments;
governed by many daring and wicked ministers;
yet none of them ever ventured to
touch the PALLADIUM <span class="smcap">of American
Liberty</span>. Ambition, avarice, faction, tyranny,
all revered it. Whenever it was necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
to raise money on the colonies, the
requisitions of the crown were made, and
dutifully complied with. The parliament
from time to time regulated their trade, and
that of the rest of the empire, to preserve
their dependencies, and the connection of
the whole in good order.</p>

<p>The people of Great-Britain in support of
their privileges, boast much of their antiquity.
Yet it may well be questioned, if there
is a single privilege of a British subject, supported
by longer, more solemn, or more uninterrupted
testimony, than the exclusive right
of taxation in these colonies. The people of
Great-Britain consider that kingdom as the
sovereign of these colonies, and would now
annex to that sovereignty a prerogative never
heard of before. How would they bear
this, was the case their own? What would
they think of a new prerogative claimed by
the crown? We may guess what their conduct
would be from the transports of passion
into which they fell about the late embargo,
laid to remove the most emergent necessities
of state, admitting of no delay; and
for which there were numerous precedents.
Let our liberties be treated with the same
tenderness, and it is all we desire.</p>

<p>Explicit as the conduct of parliaments, for
so many ages, is, to prove that no money
can be levied on these colonies, by parliament
for the purpose of raising a revenue;
yet it is not the only evidence in our favour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>Every one of the most material arguments
against the legality of the Stamp-act operates
with equal force against the act now objected
to; but as they are well known, it seems
unnecessary to repeat them here.</p>

<p>This general one only shall be considered
at present. That tho' these colonies are dependant
on Great-Britain; and tho' she has
a legal power to make laws for preserving
that dependance; yet it is not necessary for
this purpose, nor essential to the relation between
a mother-country and her colonies,
as was eagerly contended by the advocates
for the Stamp-act, that she should raise money
upon them without their consent.</p>

<p>Colonies were formerly planted by warlike
nations, to keep their enemies in awe;
to relieve their country overburthened with
inhabitants; or to discharge a number of
discontented and troublesome citizens. But
in more modern ages, the spirit of violence
being in some measure, if the expression may
be allowed, sheathed in commerce, colonies
have been settled by the nations of Europe
for the purposes of trade. These purposes
were to be attained by the colonies raising
for their mother country those things which
she did not produce herself; and by supplying
themselves from her with things they
wanted. These were the national objects
in the commencement of our colonies, and
have been uniformly so in their promotion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>To answer these grand purposes, perfect
liberty was known to be necessary; all history
proving, that trade and freedom are
nearly related to each other. By a due regard
to this wise and just plan, the infant colonies
exposed in the unknown climates, and
unexplored wildernesses of this new world,
lived, grew, and flourished.</p>

<p>The parent country with undeviating prudence
and virtue, attentive to the first principles
of colonization, drew to herself the
benefits she might reasonably expect, and
preserved to her children the blessings, on
which those benefits were founded. She
made laws obliging her colonies to carry to
her all those products which she wanted for
her own use; and all those raw materials
which she chose herself to work up. Besides
this restriction, she forbade them to procure
manufactures from any other part of the
globe; or even the products of European
countries, which alone could rival her,
without being first brought to her. In short,
by a variety of laws, she regulated their
trade in such a manner, as she thought most
conducive to their mutual advantage, and
her own welfare. A power was reserved to
the crown of repealing any laws that should
be enacted. The executive authority of
government was all lodged in the crown
and its representatives; and an appeal was
secured to the crown from all judgments in
the administration of justice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>For all these powers established by the
mother country over the colonies; for all
these immense emoluments derived by her
from them; for all their difficulties and distresses
in fixing themselves, what was the recompense
made them? A communication of
her rights in general, and particularly of
that great one, the foundation of all the
rest&mdash;that their property, acquired with so
much pain and hazard, should not be disposed
of by<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> any one but themselves&mdash;or to use
the beautiful and emphatic language of the
sacred scriptures, "that they should sit
every man under his vine, and under his fig
tree, and none should make them afraid."<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Can any man of candour and knowledge
deny, that these institutions, form an affinity
between Great-Britain and her colonies,
that sufficiently secures their dependance
upon her? or that for her to levy taxes
upon them, is to reverse the nature of things?
or that she can pursue such a measure, without
reducing them to a state of vassalage?</p>

<p>If any person cannot conceive the supremacy
of Great Britain to exist, without the
power of laying taxes to levy money upon
us, the history of the colonies and of Great-Britain
since their settlement will prove the
contrary. He will there find the amazing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
advantages arising to her from them&mdash;The
constant exercise of her supremacy&mdash;and
their filial submission to it, without a single
rebellion, or even the thought of one, from
the first emigration to this moment&mdash;and
all these things have happened, without an
instance of Great-Britain laying taxes to
levy money upon them.</p>

<p>How many British authors<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> have remonstrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
that the present wealth, power and
glory of their country are founded on these
colonies? As constantly as streams tend to
the ocean, have they been pouring the fruits
of all their labours into their mother's lap.
Good Heaven! And shall a total oblivion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
former tendernesses and blessings be spread
over the minds of a wise people, by the sordid
acts of intriguing men, who covering
their selfish projects under pretences of public
good, first enrage their countrymen into a
frenzy of passion, and then advance their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
own influence and interest, by gratifying that
passion, which they themselves have barely
excited?</p>

<p>Hitherto Great-Britain has been contented
with her prosperity. Moderation has been
the rule of her conduct. But now a generous
and humane people that so often has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
protected the liberty of strangers, is inflamed
into an attempt to tear a privilege from her
own children, which, if executed, must in
their opinion, sink them into slaves: And
for what? For a pernicious power, not
necessary to her, as her own experience may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
convince her; but horribly dreadful and detestable
to them.</p>

<p>It seems extremely probable, that when
cool, dispassionate posterity shall consider
the affectionate intercourse, the reciprocal
benefits, and the unsuspecting confidence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
that have subsisted between these colonies
and their parent country, for such a length
of time, they will execrate with the bitterest
curses the infamous memory of those men,
whose pestilential ambition, unnecessarily,
wantonly, first opened the sources of civil
discord, between them; first turned their
love into jealousy; and first taught these
provinces, filled with grief and anxiety, to
enquire,</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_VI" id="LETTER_VI">LETTER VI.</a></h2>


<p><i>Beloved Countrymen,</i></p>

<p>It may perhaps be objected against the arguments
that have been offered to the
public concerning the legal power of the
parliament, that it has always exercised the
power of imposing duties for the purposes
of raising a revenue on the productions of
these colonies carried to Great-Britain, which
may be called a tax on them. To this I
answer; that is no more a violation of the
rights of the colonies, than their being ordered
to carry certain of their productions to
Great-Britain, which is no violation at all;
it being implied in the relation between them,
that the colonies should not carry such commodities
to other nations, as should enable
them to interfere with the mother country.
The duties imposed on these commodities
when brought to her, are only a consequence
of her paternal right; and if the point is
thoroughly examined, will be found to be
laid on the people of the mother country,
and not at all dangerous to the liberties of
the colonies. Whatever these duties are,
they must proportionably raise the price of
the goods, and consequently the duties must be
paid by the consumers. In this light they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
considered by the parliament in the 25 Char.
II. Chap. 7, sec. 2, which says, that the productions
of the plantations were carried from
one to another free from all customs "while
the subjects of this your kingdom of England
have paid great customs and impositions
for what of them have been spent
here, &amp;c." Such duties therefore can never
be injurious to the liberties of the colonies.</p>

<p>Besides, if Great-Britain exports these
commodities again, the duties will injure her
own trade, so that she cannot hurt us without
plainly and immediately hurting herself;
and this is our check against her acting arbitrarily
in this respect.</p>

<p>It<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> may, perhaps, be further objected,
"that it being granted that statutes made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
for regulating trade are binding upon us,
it will be difficult for any persons but the
makers of the laws to determine, which
of them are made for the regulating of
trade, and which for raising a revenue;
and that from hence may arise confusion."</p>

<p>To this I answer, that the objection is of
no force in the present case, or such as resemble
it, because the act now in question
is formed expressly for the sole purpose of
raising a revenue.</p>

<p>However, supposing the design of the parliament
had not been expressed, the objection
seems to me of no weight, with regard
to the influence, which those who may make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
it, might expect it ought to have on the
conduct of the colonies.</p>

<p>It is true, that impositions for raising a
revenue, may be hereafter called regulations
of trade, but names will not change the nature
of things. Indeed we ought firmly to
believe, what is an undoubted truth, confirmed
by the unhappy experience of many states
heretofore free, that unless the most watchful
attention be exerted, a new servitude
may be slipped upon us under the sanction
of usual and respectable terms.</p>

<p>Thus the Cæsars ruined Roman liberty,
under the titles of tribunical and dictatorial
authorities,&mdash;&mdash;old and venerable dignities,
known in the most flourishing times of freedom.
In imitation of the same policy, James
II. when he meant to establish popery, talked
of liberty of conscience, the most sacred
of all liberties; and had thereby almost deceived
the dissenters into destruction.</p>

<p>All artful rulers, who strive to extend their
own power beyond its just limits, endeavour
to give to their attempts, as much semblance
of legality as possible. Those who succeed
them may venture to go a little farther; for
each new encroachment will be strengthened
by a former,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>"That which is now supported
by examples, growing old, will become
an example itself," and thus support
fresh usurpations.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>
<p>A free people, therefore, can never be
too quick in observing, nor too firm in opposing
the beginnings of alterations, either
in form or reality, respecting institutions
formed for their security. The first leads
to the last; on the other hand nothing is
more certain, than that forms of liberty may
be retained, when the substance is gone. In
government as well as in religion, "the
letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>I will beg leave to enforce this remark by
a few instances. The crown, by the constitution,
has the prerogative of creating peers;
the existence of that order in due number
and dignity, is essential to the constitution;
and if the crown did not exercise that prerogative,
the peerage must have long since
decreased so much, as to have lost its proper
influence. Suppose a prince for some unjust
purposes, should from time to time advance
many needy profligate wretches, to that
rank, that all the independance of the house
of Lords should be destroyed, there would
then be a manifest violation of the constitution,
under the appearance of using legal prerogative.</p>

<p>The house of Commons claim the privilege
of forming all money-bills, and will
not suffer either of the other branches of the
legislature to add to or alter them; contending
that their power, simply extends to an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
acceptance or rejection of them. This privilege
appears to be just; but under pretence
of this just privilege, the house of Commons
has claimed a licence of tacking to money
bills, clauses relating to many things of a totally
different kind, and have thus forced them,
in a manner, on the crown and lords. This
seems to be an abuse of that privilege, and
it may be vastly more abused. Suppose a
future house; influenced by some displaced
discontented demagogues, in a time of danger,
should tack to a money bill something
so injurious to the king and peers, that they
would not assent to it and yet the Commons
should obstinately insist on it; the whole kingdom
would be exposed to ruin, <em>under the appearance
of maintaining a valuable privilege</em>.</p>

<p>In these cases it might be difficult for a
while to determine, whether the King intended
to exercise his prerogative in a constitutional
manner or not; or whether the
Commons insisted on the demand factitiously,
or for the public good: But surely the conduct
of the crown, or of the house, would
in time sufficiently explain itself.</p>

<p>Ought not the people therefore to watch
to observe facts? to search into causes? to
investigate designs? and have they not a
right of judging from the evidence before
them, on no slighter points than their liberty
and happiness? It would be less than trifling,
wherever a British government is established,
to make use of any other arguments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
to prove such a right. It is sufficient to remind
the reader of the day on which King
William landed at Torbay.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>I will now apply what has been said to
the present question. The nature of any impositions
laid by parliament on the colonies,
must determine the design in laying them.
It may not be easy in every instance to discover
that design. Whenever it is doubtful,
I think submission cannot be dangerous;
nay, it must be right: for, in my opinion,
there is no privilege the colonies claim, which
they ought, in duty and prudence, more
earnestly to maintain and defend, than the
authority of the British parliament to regulate
the trade of all her dominions. Without
this authority, the benefits she enjoys from
our commerce, must be lost to her: The
blessings we enjoy from our dependance upon
her, must be lost to us; her strength must
decay; her glory vanish; and she cannot suffer,
without our partaking in her misfortune.&mdash;&mdash;"Let
us therefore cherish her interest
as our own, and give her every thing
that it becomes FREEMEN to give or
to receive."</p>

<p>The <em>nature</em> of any impositions she may
lay upon us, may in general be known, considering
how far they relate to the preserving,
in due order, the connexion between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
several parts of the <i>British</i> empire. One thing
we may be assured of, which is this; whenever
a statute imposes duties on commodities,
to be paid only upon their exportation from
Great-Britain to these colonies, it is not a
regulation of trade, but a design to raise a
revenue upon us. Other instances may happen,
which it may not be necessary to dwell
on. I hope these colonies will never, to their
latest existence, want understanding sufficient
to discover the intentions of those who
rule over them, nor the resolution necessary
for asserting their interests. They will always
have the same right that all free states
have, of judging when their privileges are
invaded, and of using all prudent measures
for preserving them.</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_VII" id="LETTER_VII">LETTER VII.</a></h2>


<p><i>Beloved Countrymen</i>,</p>

<p>This letter is intended more particularly
for such of you, whose employment
in life may have prevented your attending to
the consideration of some points that are of
great and public importance. For many
such persons there must be even in these colonies,
where the inhabitants in general are
more intelligent than any other people, as
has been remarked by strangers, and it seems
with reason.</p>

<p>Some of you perhaps, filled as I know your
breasts are with loyalty to our most excellent
prince, and with love to our dear mother
country, may feel yourselves inclined by the
affections of your hearts, to approve every
action of those whom you so much venerate
and esteem.</p>

<p>A prejudice thus flowing from goodness
of disposition is amiable indeed. I wish it
could be indulged without danger. Did I
think this possible, the error should have
been adopted, not opposed by me. But in
truth, all men are subject to the passions and
frailties of nature; and therefore whatever regard
we entertain for the persons of those
who govern us, we should always remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
that their conduct as rulers may be influenced
by human infirmities.</p>

<p>When any laws injurious to these colonies
are passed, we cannot, with the least propriety,
suppose that any injury was intended us
by his Majesty or the Lords. For the assent
of the crown and peers to law seems, as far
as I am able to judge, to have been vested in
them, more for their own security than for
any other purpose. On the other hand, it is
the particular business of the people to enquire
and discover what regulations are useful
for themselves, and to digest and present
them in the form of bills to the other orders,
to have them enacted into laws&mdash;Where
these laws are to bind themselves, it may
be expected that the house of Commons will
very carefully consider them: But when they
are making laws, that are not designed to
bind themselves, we cannot imagine that
their deliberations will be as cautious and
scrupulous as in their own case.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>I find that this clause "privately got into an act,"
for the benefit of Capt. Cole, "to the vast loss of the nation,"
is foisted into the 3d Anne, chap. 5, intituled,
"An act for granting to her Majesty a further subsidy
on wines and merchandizes imported," with which
it has no more connexion, than with 34th Edw. I. 34th
and 35th of Henry VIII. or the 25th of Car. II. which
provide that no person shall be taxed but by himself or
his representative.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>I am told that there is a wonderful address
frequently used in carrying points in
the house of commons, by persons experienced
in these affairs&mdash;that opportunities are
watched&mdash;and sometimes votes are past, that
if all the members had been present, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
have been rejected by a great majority.
Certain it is, that when a powerful and artful
man has determined on any measure against
these colonies, he has always succeeded
in his attempt. Perhaps therefore it
will be proper for us, whenever any oppressive
act affecting us is past, to attribute it to
the inattention of the members of the house
of commons, and to the malevolence or
ambition of some factious great man, rather
than to any other cause.</p>

<p>Now I do verily believe, that the late act
of parliament imposing duties on paper, &amp;c.
was formed by Mr. Grenville and his party,
because it is evidently a part of that plan,
by which he endeavoured to render himself
popular at home; and I do also believe that
not one half of the members of the house
of commons, even of those who heard it
read, did perceive how destructive it was to
American freedom.</p>

<p>For this reason, as it is usual in Great-Britain,
to consider the King's speech, as
the speech of the ministry, it may be right
here to consider this act as the act of a party.&mdash;Perhaps
I should speak more properly if I
was to use another term.&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>There are two ways of laying taxes.&mdash;One
is by imposing a certain sum on particular
kinds of property, to be paid by the
user or consumer, or by taxing the person
at a certain sum; the other is, by imposing
a certain sum on particular kinds of property
to be paid by the seller.</p>

<p>When a man pays the first sort of tax, he
knows with certainty that he pays so much
money for a tax. The consideration for
which he pays it is remote, and it may be does
not occur to him. He is sensible too that
he is commanded and obliged to pay it as a
tax; and therefore people are apt to be displeased
with this sort of tax.</p>

<p>The other sort of tax is submitted to in
a very different manner. The purchaser of
any article very seldom reflects that the
seller raises his price so as to indemnify him
for the tax he has paid. He knows the
prices of things are continually fluctuating,
and if he thinks about the tax, he thinks
at the same time in all probability, that he
might have paid as much, if the article he
buys had not been taxed. He gets something
visible and agreeable for his money,
and tax and price are so confounded together,
that he cannot separate, or does not
chuse to take the trouble of separating
them.</p>

<p>This mode of taxation therefore is the
mode suited to arbitrary and oppressive governments.
The love of liberty is so natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
to the human heart, that unfeeling tyrants
think themselves obliged to accommodate
their schemes as much as they can to the
appearance of justice and reason, and to
deceive those whom they resolve to destroy
or oppress, by presenting to them a miserable
picture of freedom, when the inestimable
original is lost.</p>

<p>This policy did not escape the cruel and
rapacious Nero. That monster, apprehensive
that his crimes might endanger his authority
and life, thought proper to do
some popular acts to secure the obedience of
his subjects. Among other things, says<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
Tacitus, "he remitted the twenty-fifth
part of the price on the sale of slaves,
but rather in shew than reality; for the
seller being ordered to pay it, it became
a part of the price to the buyer."</p>

<p>This is the reflection of the judicious historian:
but the deluded people gave their
infamous emperor full credit for his false
generosity. Other nations have been treated
in the same manner the Romans were. The
honest industrious Germans who are settled
in different parts of this continent can inform
us, that it was this sort of tax that
drove them from their native land to our
woods, at that time the seats of perfect and
undisturbed freedom.</p>

<p>Their princes inflamed by the lust of
power and the lust of avarice, two furies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
that the more hungry they grow, transgressed
the bounds, they ought in regard to themselves,
to have observed. To keep up the deception
in the minds of subjects "there must
be," says a very learned author<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> "some
proportion between the impost and the value
of the commodity; wherefore there ought
not to be an excessive duty upon merchandizes
of little value. There are countries
in which the duty exceeds seventeen or eighteen
times the value of the commodity. In
this case the prince removes the illusion.
His subjects plainly see they are dealt with
in an unreasonable manner, which renders
them most exquisitely sensible of their slavish
situation."</p>

<p>From hence it appears that subjects may
be ground down into misery by this sort of
taxation as well as the other. They may be
as much impoverished if their money is
taken from them in this way, as in the other;
and that it will be taken, may be more evident,
by attending to a few more considerations.</p>

<p>The merchant, or importer who pays the
duty at first, will not consent to be so much
money out of pocket. He, therefore, proportionably
raises the price of his goods. It
may then be said to be a contest between
him and the person offering to buy, who
shall lose the duty. This must be decided
by the nature of the commodities and the
purchasers demand for them. If they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
mere luxuries, he is at liberty to do as he
pleases, and if he buys, he does it voluntarily:
But if they are absolute necessaries, or
conveniences which use and custom have
made requisite for the comfort of life, and
which he is not permitted, by the power
imposing the duty, to get elsewhere, there
the seller has a plain advantage, and the
buyer must pay the duty. In fact, the seller
is nothing less than the collector of the tax
for the power that imposed it. If these
duties then are extended to necessaries and
conveniences of life in general, and enormously
increased, the people must at length
become indeed "most exquisitely sensible
of their slavish situation."</p>

<p>Their happiness, therefore, entirely depends
on the moderation of those who have
authority to impose the duties.</p>

<p>I shall now apply these observations to the
late act of parliament. Certain duties are
thereby imposed on paper and glass, &amp;c. imported
into these colonies. By the laws of
<i>Great-Britain</i> we are prohibited to get these
articles from any other part of the world.
We cannot at present, nor for many years to
come, though we should apply ourselves to
these manufactures with the utmost industry,
make enough ourselves for our own use.
That paper and glass are not only convenient,
but absolutely necessary for us, I imagine very
few will contend. Some, perhaps, who
think mankind grew wicked and luxurious as
soon as they found out another way of communicating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
their sentiments than by speech,
and another way of dwelling than in caves,
may advance so whimsical an opinion. But
I presume nobody will take the unnecessary
trouble of refuting them.</p>

<p>From these remarks I think it evident, that
we must use paper and glass, that what we
use must be <i>British</i>, and that we must pay
the duties imposed unless those who sell
these articles are so generous as to make us
presents of the duties they pay, which is not
to be expected.</p>

<p>Some persons may think this act of no consequence,
because the duties are so <em>small</em>.
A fatal error. That is the very circumstance
most alarming to me. For I am convinced
that the authors of this law, would never
have obtained an act to raise so trifling
a sum, as it must do, had they not intended
by it to establish a <em>precedent</em> for future
use. To console ourselves with the <em>smallness</em>
of the duties, is to walk deliberately into the
snare that is set for us, praising the <em>neatness</em>
of the workmanship. Suppose the duties,
imposed by the late act, could be paid by
these distressed colonies, with the utmost ease,
and that the purposes, to which they are to
be applied, were the most reasonable and equitable
that could be conceived, the contrary
of which I hope to demonstrate before
these letters are concluded, yet even in such
a supposed case, these colonies ought to regard
the act with abhorrence. For who are
a free people? not those over whom government
is reasonably and equitably exercised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
but those who live under a government, so
<em>constitutionally checked</em> and <em>controuled</em>, that
proper provision is made against its being otherwise
exercised. The late act is founded on
the destruction of this constitutional security.</p>

<p>If the parliament have a right to lay a duty
of four shillings and eight pence on a hundred
weight of glass, or a ream of paper,
they have a right to lay a duty of any other
sum on either. They may raise the duty
as the author before quoted says, has been
done in some countries, till it "exceeds seventeen
or eighteen times the value of the
commodity." In short, if they have a
right to levy a tax of <em>one penny</em> upon us,
they have a right to levy a <em>million</em> upon us.
For where does their right stop? At any given
number of pence, shillings, or pounds?
To attempt to limit their right, after granting
it to exist at all, is as contrary to reason,
as granting it to exist at all is contrary to
justice. If they have any right to tax us,
then, whether our own money shall continue
in our own pockets, or not, depends no longer
on <em>us</em>, but on <em>them</em>. "There is nothing
which we can call our own", or to use
the words of Mr. <i>Locke</i>, "What property
have" we "in that, which another may,
by right, take, when he pleases, to himself."<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>These duties, which will inevitably be levied
upon us, and which are now levying upon
us, are expressly laid for the sole purpose
of taking money. This is the true definition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
of taxes. They are therefore taxes. This
money is to be taken from us. We are
therefore taxed. Those who are taxed without
their own consent, given by themselves,
or their representatives, are slaves.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> We are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
taxed without our own consent given by
ourselves, or our representatives. We are
therefore&mdash;&mdash;I speak it with grief&mdash;&mdash;I
speak it with indignation&mdash;&mdash;we are slaves.</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_VIII" id="LETTER_VIII">LETTER VIII.</a></h2>


<p><i>Beloved Countrymen</i>,</p>

<p>In my opinion, a dangerous example is
set in the last act relating to these colonies.
The power of parliament to levy
money upon us for raising a revenue, is
therein avowed and exerted. Regarding
the act on this single principle, I must again
repeat, and I think it my duty to repeat,
that to me it appears to be unconstitutional.</p>

<p>No man, who considers the conduct of
parliament since the repeal of the Stamp-act,
and the disposition of many people at home,
can doubt, that the chief object of attention
there, is, to use Mr. Grenville's expression,
"providing that the dependance and obedience
of the colonies be asserted and maintained."</p>

<p>Under the influence of this notion, instantly
on repealing the Stamp-act, an act passed,
declaring the power of parliament to bind
these colonies in all cases whatever. This,
however, was only planting a barren tree,
that cast a shade indeed over the colonies,
but yielded no fruit. It being determined
to enforce the authority on which the Stamp-act
was founded, the parliament having
never renounced the right, as Mr. Pitt advised
them to do; and it being thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
proper to disguise that authority in such a
manner, as not again to alarm the colonies;
some little time was required to find
a method, by which both these points should
be united. At last the ingenuity of Mr.
Greenville and his party accomplished the
matter, as it was thought, in "An act for
granting certain duties in the British colonies
and plantations in America, for allowing
drawbacks, &amp;c. which is the title of the
act laying duties on paper, &amp;c."</p>

<p>The parliament having several times before
imposed duties to be paid in America,
it was expected no doubt, that the repetition
of such a measure would be passed over
as an usual thing. But to have done this,
without expressly asserting and maintaining
"the power of parliament to take our money
without our consent," and to apply it as
they please, would not have been sufficiently
declarative of its supremacy, nor sufficiently
depressive of American freedom.</p>

<p>Therefore it is, that in this memorable act
we find it expressly "provided" that money
shall be levied upon us without our consent,
for purposes, that render it, if possible, more
dreadful than the Stamp-act.</p>

<p>That act, alarming as it was, declared,
the money thereby to be raised, should be
applied "towards defraying the expences
of defending, protecting and securing the
British colonies and plantations in America:"
And it is evident from the whole
act, that by the word "British" were intended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
colonies and plantations settled by
British people, and not generally, those subject
to the British crown. That act therefore
seemed to have something gentle and kind in
its intention, and to aim only at our own welfare:
But the act now objected to, imposes
duties upon the British colonies, "to defray
the expences of defending, protecting and
securing his Majesty's dominions in America."</p>

<p>What a change of words! What an incomputable
addition to the expences intended by
the Stamp-act! "His Majesty's dominions"
comprehended not only the British colonies;
but also the conquered provinces of Canada
and Florida, and the British garrisons of Nova-Scotia;
for these do not deserve the name
of colonies.</p>

<p>What justice is there in making us pay for
"defending, protecting and securing" these
places? What benefit can we, or have we ever
derived from them? None of them was conquered
for us; nor will "be defended, protected
and secured" for us.</p>

<p>In fact, however advantageous the subduing
or keeping any of these countries may be to
Great-Britain, the acquisition is greatly injurious
to these colonies. Our chief property
consists in lands. These would have been of
a much greater value, if such prodigious additions
had not been made to the British territories
on this continent. The natural increase
of our own people, if confined within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the colonies, would have raised the value still
higher and higher, every fifteen or twenty
years. Besides, we should have lived more
compactly together, and have been therefore
more able to resist any enemy.</p>

<p>But now the inhabitants will be thinly
scattered over an immense region, as those
who want settlements, will chuse to make
new ones, rather than pay great prices for
old ones.</p>

<p>These are the consequences to the colonies
of the hearty assistance they gave to Great-Britain
in the late war.&mdash;&mdash;A war, undertaken
solely for her own benefit. The objects
of it were, the securing to herself the rich
tracts of land on the back of these colonies,
with the Indian trade, and Nova-Scotia with
the fishery. These, and much more has that
kingdom gained; but the inferior animals
that hunted with the Lion, have been amply
rewarded for all the sweat and blood their
loyalty cost them, by the honour of having
sweated and bled in such company.</p>

<p>I will not go so far as to say, that Canada
and Nova-Scotia are curbs on New-England;
the chain of forts through the back
woods, on the middle provinces; and Florida,
on the rest: but I will venture to say, that
if the products of Canada, Nova-Scotia and
Florida, deserve any consideration, the two
first of them are only rivals of our northern
colonies and the other of our southern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>It has been said, that without the conquest
of these countries, the colonies could not
have been "protected, defended, and secured;"
If that is true, it may with as much
propriety be said, that Great-Britain could
not have been "defended, protected, and
secured" without that conquest: for the
colonies are parts of her empire, which it
is as much concerns her as them to keep out
of the hands of any other power.</p>

<p>But these colonies when they were much
weaker, defended themselves, before this
conquest was made; and could again do it,
against any that might properly be called
their enemies. If France and Spain indeed
should attack them, as members of the British
empire perhaps they might be distressed;
but it would be in a British quarrel.</p>

<p>The largest account I have seen of the number
of people in Canada, does not make them
exceed 90,000. Florida can hardly be said to
have any inhabitants&mdash;&mdash;It is computed that
there are in our colonies, 3,000,000.&mdash;Our
force therefore must encrease with a disproportion
to the growth of their strength, that
would render us very safe.</p>

<p>This being the state of the case, I cannot
think it just, that these colonies, labouring
under so many misfortunes, should be loaded
with taxes, to maintain countries not only
not useful, but hurtful to them. The support
of Canada and Florida cost yearly, it is
said, half a million sterling. From hence we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
may make some guess of the load that is to
be laid upon us; for we are not only to "defend,
protect, and secure" them, but also
to make "an adequate provision for defraying
the charge of the administration of
justice and the support of civil government,
in such provinces where it shall be
found necessary."</p>

<p>Not one of the provinces of Canada, Nova-Scotia,
or Florida, has ever defrayed these
expences within itself: And if the duties imposed
by the last statute are collected, all
of them together, according to the best information
I can get, will not pay one-quarter
as much as Pennsylvania alone. So that
the British colonies are to be drained of the
rewards of their labour, to cherish the
scorching sands of Florida, and the icy
rocks of Canada and Nova-Scotia, which
never will return to us one farthing that we
send to them.</p>

<p>Great-Britain&mdash;&mdash;I mean the ministry in
Great-Britain, has cantoned Canada and
Florida out into five or six governments,
and may form as many more. She now has
fourteen or fifteen regiments on this continent;
and may send over as many more.
To make "an adequate provision" for all
these expences, is, no doubt, to be the inheritance
of the colonies.</p>

<p>Can any man believe that the duties upon
paper, &amp;c. are the last that will be laid for
these purposes? It is in vain to hope, that
because it is imprudent to lay duties on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
exportation of manufactures from a mother
country to colonies, as it may promote manufactures
among them, that this consideration
will prevent them.</p>

<p>Ambitious, artful men have made the
measure popular, and whatever injustice or
destruction will attend it in the opinion of
the colonists, at home it will be thought
just and salutary.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>The people of Great-Britain will be told,
and they have been told, that they are sinking
under an immense debt&mdash;that great part
of this debt has been contracted in defending
the colonies&mdash;that these are so ungrateful
and undutiful, that they will not contribute
one mite to its payment&mdash;nor even to
the support of the army now kept up for
their "protection and security"&mdash;that they
are rolling in wealth, and are of so bold
and republican a spirit, that they are aiming
at independence&mdash;that the only way to retain
them in "obedience" is to keep a
strict watch over them, and to draw off part
of their riches in taxes&mdash;and that every burden
laid upon them is taking off so much
from Great-Britain&mdash;These assertions will
be generally believed, and the people will
be persuaded that they cannot be too angry
with their colonies, as that anger will be
profitable to themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>In truth, Great-Britain alone receives any
benefit from Canada, Nova-Scotia, and
Florida; and therefore she alone ought to
maintain them.&mdash;The old maxim of the law
is drawn from reason and justice, and never
could be more properly applied, than in this
case.</p>

<p><i>Beloved Countrymen</i>,</p>

<p>I have made some observations on the
purposes for which money is to be levied
upon us by the late act of parliament. I
shall now offer to your consideration some
further reflections on that subject; and, unless
I am greatly mistaken, if these purposes
are accomplished, according to the exprest
intention of the act, they will be found
effectually to supersede that authority in our
respective assemblies, which is most essential
to liberty. The question is not whether
some branches shall be lopt off&mdash;The ax is
laid to the root of the tree; and the whole
body must infallibly perish, if we remain idle
spectators of the work.</p>

<p>No free people ever existed, or ever can
exist, without, keeping, to use a common
but strong expression, "the purse strings"
in their own hands. Where this is the case,
they have a constitutional check upon the
administration, which may thereby be
brought into order without violence: but
where such a power is not lodged in the
people, oppression proceeds uncontrouled
in its career, till the governed, transported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
into rage, seeks redress in the midst of blood
and confusion.</p>

<p>The elegant and ingenious Mr. Hume,
speaking of the Anglo-Norman government,
says "princes and ministers were too ignorant
to be themselves sensible of the advantages
attending an equitable administration;
and there was no established
council or assembly which could protect
the people, and, by withdrawing supplies,
regularly and peaceably admonish
the King of his duty, and ensure the execution of
the laws."</p>

<p>Thus this great man, whose political reflections
are so much admired, makes this
power one of the foundations of liberty.</p>

<p>The English history abounds with instances,
proving that this is the proper and successful
way to obtain redress of grievances.
How often have Kings and ministers endeavoured
to throw off this legal curb upon
them, by attempting to raise money by a
variety of inventions, under pretence of law,
without having recourse to parliament?
And how often have they been brought to
reason, and peaceably obliged to do justice,
by the exertion of this constitutional authority
of the people, vested in their representatives?</p>

<p>The inhabitants of these colonies have on
numberless occasions, reaped the benefits
of this authority lodged in their assemblies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>It has been for a long time, and now is,
a constant instruction to all governors, to
obtain a permanent support for the officers
of government. But as the author of the
administration of the colonies says, "this
order of the crown is generally, if not
universally, rejected by the legislatures of
the colonies."</p>

<p>They perfectly know how much their grievances
would be regarded, if they had no other
method of engaging attention, than
by complaining. Those who rule, are extremely
apt to think well of the constructions
made by themselves, in support of their
own power. These are frequently erroneous
and pernicious to those they govern&mdash;Dry
remonstrances, to shew that such constructions
are wrong and oppressive, carry
very little weight with them, in the opinion
of persons, who gratify their own inclinations
in making these constructions. They
cannot understand the reasoning that opposes
their power and desire: but let it be made
their interest to understand such reasoning&mdash;and
a wonderful light is instantly thrown on
the matter; and then rejected remonstrances
become as clear as "proof of holy
writ."<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>The three most important articles, that
our assemblies, or any legislatures can provide
for, are, first the defence of the society:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
secondly&mdash;the administration of justice:
and, thirdly, the support of civil government.</p>

<p>Nothing can properly regulate the expence
of making provision for these occasions,
but the necessities of the society; its abilities;
the conveniency of the modes of
levying money among them; the manner
in which the laws have been executed; and
the conduct of the officers of government;
all which are circumstances that cannot possibly
be properly known, but by the society
itself; or, if they should be known, will
not, probably, be properly considered, but
by that society.</p>

<p>If money may be raised upon us, by others,
without our consent, for our "defence,"
those who are the judges in levying
it, must also be the judges in applying
it. Of consequence, the money said to be
taken from us for our defence, may be employed
to our injury. We may be chained
in by a line of fortifications: obliged to pay
for building and maintaining them; and be
told that they are for our defence. With what
face can we dispute the fact, after having
granted, that those who apply the money,
had a right to levy it; for, surely, it is
much easier for their wisdom to understand
how to apply it in the best manner, than
how to levy it in the best manner. Besides,
the right of levying is of infinitely more
consequence, than that of applying it. The
people of England, that would burst out into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
fury, if the crown should attempt to levy
money by its own authority, have assigned
to the crown the application of money.</p>

<p>As to "the administration of justice"&mdash;the
judges ought, in a well regulated state, to
be equally independant of the legislative
powers. Thus, in England, judges hold
their commissions from the crown "during
good behaviour;" and have salaries, suitable
to their dignity, settled on them by
parliament. The purity of the courts of
law, since this establishment, is a proof of
the wisdom with which it was made.</p>

<p>But, in these colonies, how fruitless has
been every attempt to have the judges appointed
during good behaviour; yet whoever
considers the matter will soon perceive,
that such commissions are beyond all comparison
more necessary in these colonies, than
they are in England.</p>

<p>The chief danger to the subject there, arose
from the arbitrary designs of the crown;
but here, the time may come, when we
may have to contend with the designs of the
crown, and of a mighty kingdom. What
then will be our chance, when the laws of
life and death, are to be spoken by judges,
totally dependant on that crown and kingdom&mdash;sent
over, perhaps, from thence&mdash;filled
with British prejudice&mdash;and backed by
a standing army, supported out of our own
pockets, to "assert and maintain" our own
"dependance and obedience."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>But supposing, that through the extreme
lenity that will prevail in the government,
through all future ages, these colonies never
will behold any thing like the campaign of
chief justice Jeffereys, yet what innumerable
acts of injustice may be committed, and
how fatally may the principles of liberty be
sapped by a succession of judges utterly independant
of the people? Before such judges,
the supple wretches, who cheerfully join in
avowing sentiments inconsistent with freedom,
will always meet with smiles: while the honest
and brave men, who disdain to sacrifice
their native land to their own advantage, but
on every occasion, boldly vindicate her cause,
will constantly be regarded with frowns.</p>

<p>There are two other considerations, relating
to this head, that deserve the most
serious attention.</p>

<p>By the late act the officers of the customs
are impowered "to enter into any house,
warehouse, shop, cellar, or other place,
in the British colonies or plantations in
America, to search for, or seize prohibited
or unaccustomed goods," &amp;c. on "writs
granted by the inferior or supreme court
of justice, having jurisdiction within such
colony or plantation respectively."</p>

<p>If we only reflect that the judges of these
courts are to be <em>during pleasure</em>&mdash;that they
are to have "<em>adequate provision</em>" made
for them, which is to continue during their
<em>complisant behaviour</em>&mdash;that they may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
stranger to these colonies&mdash;what an engine
of oppression may this authority be in such
hands?</p>

<p>I am well aware that writs of this kind
may be granted at home, under the seal of
the court of exchequer: But I know also
that the greatest asserters of the rights of
Englishmen, have always strenuously contended,
that such a power was dangerous to freedom,
and expressly contrary to the common
law, which ever regarded a man's house, as
his castle, or a place of perfect security.</p>

<p>If such a power is in the least degree dangerous
there, it must be utterly destructive
to liberty here.&mdash;For the people there have
two securities against the undue exercise of
this power by the crown, which are wanting
with us, if the late act takes place. In
the first place, if any injustice is done there,
the person injured may bring his action
against the offender, and have it tried by
independant judges, who are<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> no parties in
committing the injury. Here he must have
it tried before dependant judges, being the
men who granted the writ.</p>

<p>To say that the cause is to be tried by a
jury can never reconcile men, who have any
idea of freedom to such a power.&mdash;For we
know, that sheriffs in almost every colony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
on this continent, are totally dependant on
the crown; and packing of juries has been
frequently practiced even in the capital of
the British empire. Even if juries are
well inclined, we have too many instances
of the influence of overbearing unjust
judges upon them. The brave and wise
men who accomplished the revolution,
thought the independency of judges essential
to freedom.</p>

<p>The other security which the people have
at home, but which we shall want here, is
this.&mdash;If this power is abused there, the parliament,
the grand resource of the opprest
people, is ready to afford relief. Redress of
grievances must precede grants of money.
But what regard can we expect to have
paid to our assemblies, when they will not
hold even the puny privilege of French parliaments&mdash;&mdash;that
of registering the edicts,
that take away our money, before they are
put in execution.</p>

<p>The second consideration above hinted at,
is this&mdash;There is a confusion in our laws that
is quite unknown in Great-Britain. As this
cannot be described in a more clear or exact
manner, than has been done by the ingenious
author of the history of New-York, I
beg leave to use his words. "The state of
our laws opens a door to much controversy.
The uncertainty which respect them, renders
property precarious, and greatly exposes
us to the arbitrary decision of unjust judges.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
The common law of England is generally
received, together with such statutes,
as were enacted before we had a legislature
of our own; but our courts exercise a sovereign
authority, in determining what parts
of the common and statute law ought to be
extended: For it must be admitted, that the
difference of circumstances necessarily requires
us, in some cases, to reject the determination
of both. In many instances they have also
extended even acts of parliament, passed
since we had a distinct legislature, which is
greatly adding to our confusion. The practice
of our courts is no less uncertain than
the law. Some of the English rules are adopted,
others rejected. Two things therefore
seem to be absolutely necessary for the
public security. First the passing an act for
settling the extent of the English laws. Secondly,
that the courts ordain a general set
of rules for the regulation of the practice."</p>

<p>How easy will it be under this "state of
our laws" for an artful judge to act in
the most arbitrary manner, and yet cover his
conduct under specious pretences, and how
difficult will it be for the injured people to
obtain redress, may be readily perceived. We
may take a voyage of three thousand miles
to complain; and after the trouble and hazard
we have undergone, we may be told,
that the collection of the revenue and maintenance
of the prerogative, must not be discouraged.&mdash;&mdash;And
if the misbehaviour is so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
gross as to admit of no justification, it may
be said that it was an error in judgment only,
arising from the confusion of our laws,
and the zeal of the King's servants to do
their duty.</p>

<p>If the commissions of judges are during
the pleasure of the crown, yet if their salaries
are during the pleasure of the people,
there will be some check upon their conduct.
Few men will consent to draw on themselves
the hatred and contempt of those among
whom we live, for the empty honour of
being judges. It is the sordid love of
gain that tempts men to turn their backs on
virtue, and pay their homage where they
ought not.</p>

<p>As to the third particular, the "support
of civil government," few words will be
sufficient. Every man of the least understanding
must know, that the executive power
may be exercised in a manner so disagreeable
and harassing to the people, that it is absolutely
requisite, they should be enabled by the
gentlest method which human policy has yet
been ingenious enough to invent, that is by
the shutting their hands, to "admonish"
(as Mr. Hume says) certain persons "of
their duty."</p>

<p>What shall we now think, when, upon
looking into the late act, we find the assemblies
of these provinces thereby stript of their
authority on these several heads? The declared
intention of that act is, "that a revenue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
should be raised in his Majesty's dominions
in America, for making a more certain
and adequate provision for defraying the
charge of the administration of justice, and
the support of civil government, in such provinces
where it shall be found necessary; and
towards further defraying the expences of
defending, protecting, and securing the said
dominions," &amp;c.</p>

<p>Let the reader pause here one moment,
and reflect&mdash;whether the colony in which he
lives, has not made such "certain and adequate
provisions" for these purposes, as
is by the colony judged suitable to its abilities,
and all other circumstances. Then let
him reflect&mdash;whether, if this act takes place,
money is not to be raised on that colony
without its consent to make provision for
these purposes, which it does not judge to
be suitable to its abilities, and all other circumstances.
Lastly, let him reflect&mdash;whether
the people of that country are not in
a state of the most abject slavery, whose
property may be taken from them under the
notion of right, when they have refused to
give it. For my part, I think I have good
reason for vindicating the honour of the assemblies
on this continent, by publicly asserting,
that they have made as "certain and
adequate provision" for the purposes above-mentioned,
as they ought to have
made; and that it should not be presumed,
that they will not do it hereafter. Why then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
should these most important truths be
wrested out of their hands? Why should
they not now be permitted to enjoy that
authority, which they have exercised from
the first settlement of these colonies? Why
should they be scandalized by this innovation,
when their respective provinces are now,
and will be for several years, labouring under
loads of debts imposed on them for the
very purposes now spoken of? Why should
the inhabitants of all these colonies be with
the utmost indignity treated, as a herd of
despicable wretches, so utterly void of common
sense, that they will not even make
"adequate provision" for the "administration
of justice" and "the support of
civil government" among them, for their
"own defence"&mdash;though without such
"provision" every people must inevitably
be overwhelmed with anarchy and destruction?
Is it possible to form an idea of slavery
more complete, more miserable, more disgraceful,
than that of a people, where justice
is administered, government exercised,
and a standing army maintained, at the expence
of the people, and yet without the
least dependance upon them? If we can find
no relief from this infamous situation, let
Mr. Grenville set his fertile fancy again to
work, and as by one exertion of it, he has
stripped us of our property and liberty, let
him by another deprive us of our understanding
too, that unconscious of what we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
been or are, and ungoaded by tormenting
reflections, we may tamely bow down our
necks with all the stupid serenity of servitude,
to any drudgery, which our lords and masters
may please to command.&mdash;</p>

<p>When the "charges of the administration
of justice,"&mdash;"the support of civil government;"&mdash;and
"the expences of defending
protecting and securing" us, are provided
for, I should be glad to know upon what
occasion the crown will ever call our assemblies
together. Some few of them may
meet of their own accord, by virtue of their
charters: But what will they have to do
when they are met? To what shadows will
they be reduced? The men, whose deliberations
heretofore had an influence on every
matter relating to the liberty and happiness
of themselves and their constituents, and
whose authority in domestic affairs, at least,
might well be compared to that of Roman
senators, will now find their deliberations of
no more consequence than those of constables.&mdash;They
may perhaps be allowed to
make laws for yoking of hogs, or pounding
of stray cattle. Their influence will hardly
be permitted to extend so high as the keeping
roads in repair, as that business may more
properly be executed by those who receive
the public cash.</p>

<p>One most memorable example in history
is so applicable to the point now insisted on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
that it will form a just conclusion of the observations
that have been made.</p>

<p>Spain was once free. Their <i>Cortes</i> resembled
our parliament. No money could be
raised on the subject, without their consent.
One of their Kings having received a grant
from them to maintain a war against the
Moors, desired, that if the sum which they
had given, should not be sufficient, he
might be allowed for that emergency only,
to have more money, without assembling the
<i>Cortes</i>. The request was violently opposed
by the best and wisest men in the assembly.
It was however, complied with by the votes
of a majority; and this single concession
was a precedent for other concessions of the
like kinds, until, at last, the crown obtained
a general power for raising money in cases
of necessity. From that period the <i>Cortes</i>
ceased to be useful, and the people ceased to
be free.</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_X" id="LETTER_X">LETTER X.</a></h2>


<p><i>Beloved Countrymen</i>,</p>

<p>The consequences, mentioned in the last
letter, will not be the utmost limits of
our misery and infamy. We feel too sensibly
that any<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> ministerial measures, relating to
these colonies, are soon carried successfully
thro' the parliament. Certain prejudices operate
there so strongly against us, that it
might justly be questioned, whether all the
provinces united, will ever be able effectually
to call to an account, before the parliament,
any minister who shall abuse the power by
the late act given to the crown in America.
He may divide the spoils torn from us, in
what manner he pleases; and we shall have
no way of making him responsible. If he
should order, that every Governor, should
have a yearly salary of 5000<i>l.</i> sterling, every
chief justice of 3000<i>l.</i> every inferior officer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
in proportion; and should then reward
the most profligate, ignorant, or needy dependants
on himself, or his friends with places
of the greatest trust because they were
of the greatest profit, this would be called
an arrangement in consequence of the "adequate
provision for defraying the charge
of the administration of justice, and the support
of the civil government." And if the
taxes should prove at any time insufficient to
answer all the expences of the numberless
offices, which ministers may please to create,
surely the house of Commons would be too
"modest" to contradict a minister who should
tell them, it was become necessary to lay a
new tax upon the colonies, for the laudable
purpose of "defraying the charges of the
administration of justice, and the support
of civil government" among them. Thus
in fact we shall be taxed by ministers.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>We may perceive, from the example of
Ireland, how eager ministers are to seize upon
any settled revenue, and apply it in supporting
their own power.&mdash;&mdash;Happy are the
men, and happy are the people, who grow
wise by the misfortune of others. Earnestly,
my dear countrymen, do I beseech the
author of all good gifts, that you may grow
wise in this manner: And, if I may be allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
to take the liberty, I beg leave to recommend
to you in general, as the best method
of obtaining wisdom, diligently to study
the histories of other countries. You will
there find all the arts, that can possibly be
practiced by cunning rulers, or false patriots
among yourselves, so fully delineated,
that changing names, the account would
serve for your own times.</p>

<p>It is pretty well known on this continent,
that Ireland has, with a regular consistence
of injustice, been cruelly treated by ministers
in the article of pensions; but there are
some alarming circumstances relating to that
subject, which I wish to have better known
among us.
<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
The revenue of the crown there, arises
principally from the excise granted "for
pay of the army, and defraying other
public charges in defence and preservation
of the kingdom"&mdash;from the tonnage and
additional poundage granted "for protecting
the trade of the kingdom at sea, and
augmenting the public revenue" from the
hearth-money granted, as a "public revenue
for public charges and expences."
There are some other branches of the revenue,
concerning which there is not any express
appropriation of them for public service,
but which were plainly so intended.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>
<p>Of these branches of the revenue, the
crown is only a trustee for the public. They
are unalienable; they are inapplicable to
any other purposes, but those for which
they were established; and therefore are not
legally chargeable with pensions.</p>

<p>There is another kind of revenue, which
is a private revenue. This is not limited to
any public uses; but the crown has the same
property in it, that any person has in his
estate. This does not amount at the most
to fifteen thousand pounds a year, probably
not to seven; and it is the only revenue that
can legally be charged with pensions. If ministers
were accustomed to regard the rights
or happiness of the people, the pensions in
Ireland would not exceed the sum just mentioned:
but long since have they exceeded
that limit, and in December, 1765, a motion
was made in the House of Commons in
that kingdom, to address his Majesty, on
the great increase of pensions on the Irish
establishment, amounting to the sum of
£.158,685 in the last two years.</p>

<p>Attempts have been made to gloss over
these gross incroachments, by this specious
argument,&mdash;"That expending a competent
part of the public revenue in pensions,
from a principle of charity or generosity,
adds to the dignity of the crown, and is,
therefore, useful to the public." To give
this argument any weight, it must appear
that the pensions proceed from "charity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
or generosity" only&mdash;And that it "adds
to the dignity of the crown" to act directly
contrary to law.</p>

<p>From this conduct towards Ireland, in
open violation of law, we may easily foresee
what we may expect, when a minister
will have the whole revenue of America,
in his own hands, to be disposed of at his
own pleasure. For all the monies raised by
the late act are to be "applied, by virtue
of warrants under the sign manual, countersigned
by the high treasurer, or any
three of the commissioners of the treasury."
The "residue" indeed, is to be
paid "into the receipt of the exchequer,
and to be disposed of by parliament."
So that a minister will have nothing to do
but to take care that there shall be no "residue,"
and he is superior to all controul.</p>

<p>Besides the burden of pensions in Ireland,
which have enormously encreased within
these few years, almost all the offices, in
that poor kingdom, have, since the commencement
of the present century, and now
are bestowed upon strangers. For though
the merit of those born there justly raises
them to places of high trust, when they go
abroad, as all Europe can witness, yet he
is an uncommonly lucky Irishman, who can
get a good post in his native country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>When I consider the<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>manner in which
that island has been uniformly depressed for so
many years past, with this pernicious particularity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
of their parliament continuing<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> as
long as the crown pleases, I am astonished
to observe such a love of liberty still animating
that loyal and generous nation; and
nothing can raise higher my idea of the
integrity and public spirit of the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
who have preserved the sacred fire of freedom
from being extinguished though the
altar, on which it burned, has been thrown
down.</p>

<p>In the same manner shall we unquestionably
be treated, as soon as the late taxes,
laid upon us, shall make posts in the "government,"
and the "administration of
justice," here, worth the attention of persons
of influence in Great Britain. We know
enough already to satisfy us of this truth.
But this will not be the worst part of our
case.</p>

<p>The principals in all great offices will reside
in England, make some paltry allowance
to deputies for doing the business here.
Let any man consider what an exhausting
drain this must be upon us, when ministers
are possessed of the power of affixing what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
salaries they please to posts, and he must be
convinced how destructive the late act must
be. The injured kingdom, lately mentioned,
can tell us the mischiefs of absentees;
and we may perceive already the same disposition
taking place with us. The government
of New York has been exercised by
a deputy. That of Virginia is now held
so; and we know of a number of secretaryships,
collectorships, and other offices
held in the same manner.</p>

<p>True it is, that if the people of Great-Britain
were not too much blinded by the
passions, that have been artfully excited in
their breasts, against their dutiful children,
the colonists, these considerations would be
nearly as alarming to them as to us. The
influence of the crown was thought, by wise
men many years ago, too great, by reason
of the multitude of pensions and places bestowed
by it; these have vastly increased
since<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> and perhaps it would be no difficult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
matter to prove that the people have decreased.</p>

<p>Surely, therefore, those who wish the welfare
of their country, ought seriously to reflect
what may be the consequence of such a
new creation of offices, in the disposal of the
crown. The army, the administration of
justice, and the civil government here, with
such salaries as the crown shall please to annex,
will extend ministerial influence, as
much beyond its former bounds, as the late
war did the British dominions.</p>

<p>But whatever the people of Great-Britain
may think on this occasion, I hope the people
of these colonies will unanimously join in
this sentiment, that the late act of parliament
is injurious to their liberty; and that
this sentiment will unite them in a firm opposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
to it, in the same manner as the
dread of the Stamp-act did.</p>

<p>Some persons may imagine the sums to be
raised by it, are but small, and therefore
may be inclined to acquiesce under it. A
conduct more dangerous to freedom, as before
has been observed, can never be adopted.
Nothing is wanted at home but a precedent,
the force of which shall be established,
by the tacit submission of the colonies.
With what zeal was the statute erecting the
post-office, and another relating to the recovery
of debts in America, urged and tortured,
as precedents in the support of the Stamp-act,
though wholly inapplicable. If the parliament
succeeds in this attempt, other statutes
will impose other duties. Instead of
taxing ourselves as we have been accustomed
to do from the first settlement of these provinces;
all our useful taxes will be converted
into parliamentary taxes on our importations;
and thus the parliament will levy upon
us such sums of money as they chuse to
take, without any other limitation than their
pleasure.</p>

<p>We know how much labour and care
have been bestowed by these colonies, in laying
taxes in such a manner, that they should
be most easy to the people, by being laid on
the proper articles; most equal, by being
proportioned to every man's circumstances;
and cheapest by the method directed for
collecting them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>But parliamentary taxes will be laid on us
without any consideration, whether there is
any eassier mode. The only point regarded
will be, the certainty of levying the taxes,
and not the convenience of the people, on
whom they are to be levied, and therefore
all statutes on this head will be such as will
be most likely, according to the favourite
phrase, "to execute themselves."</p>

<p>Taxes in every free state have been, and
ought to be as exactly proportioned, as is
possible, to the abilities of those who are to
pay them. They cannot otherwise be just.
Even a Hottentot could comprehend the unreasonableness,
of making a poor man pay as
much for defending the property of a rich
man, as the rich man pays himself.</p>

<p>Let any person look into the late act of
parliament, and he will immediately perceive,
that the immense estates of Lord Fairfax,
Lord Baltimore,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> and our proprietors, which
are amongst "his Majesty's other dominions"
to be "defended, protected and secured"
by that act will not pay a single
farthing of the duties thereby imposed, except
Lord Fairfax wants some of his windows
glazed. Lord Baltimore, and our proprietors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
are quite secure, as they live in
England.</p>

<p>I mention these particular cases as striking
instances, how far the late act is a deviation
from that principle of justice, which has
so constantly distinguished our own laws on
this continent.</p>

<p>The third consideration with our continental
assemblies in laying taxes has been
the method of collecting them. This has
been done by a few officers under the inspection
of the respective assemblies, with moderate
allowances. No more was raised from
the subject, than was used for the intended
purposes. But by the late act, a minister
may appoint as many officers as he pleases
for collecting the taxes; may assign them
what salaries he thinks "adequate" and
they are to be subject to no inspection but
his own.</p>

<p>In short, if the late act of parliament
takes effect, these colonies must dwindle down
into "common corporations," as their enemies
in the debates concerning the repeal
of the Stamp-act, strenuously insisted they
were: and it is not improbable, that some
future historians will thus record our fall.</p>

<p>"The eighth year of this reign was distinguished
by a very memorable event, the
American colonies then submitting for the
first time, to be taxed by the British parliament.
An attempt of this kind had been
made two years before, but was defeated by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the vigorous exertions of the several provinces
in defence of their liberties. Their behaviour
on that occasion rendered their name
very celebrated for a short time all over Europe;
all states being extremely attentive
to a dispute between Great-Britain and so
considerable a part of her dominions. For
as she was thought to be grown too powerful
by the successful conclusion of the late
war she had been engaged in, it was hoped
by many, that as it had happened before to
other kingdoms, civil discords would afford
opportunities of revenging all the injuries
supposed to be received from her. However
the cause of dissention was removed by
a repeal of the statute, that had given offense.
This affair rendered the submissive
conduct of the colonies so soon after, the
more extraordinary; there being no difference
between the modes of taxation which
they opposed, and that to which they submitted,
but this, that by the first, they were
to be continually reminded that they were
taxed, by certain marks stampt on every
piece of paper or parchment, they used.
The authors of that statute triumphed
greatly on this conduct of the colonies, and
insisted that if the people of Great-Britain,
had persisted in enforcing it, the Americans
would have been in a few months so fatigued
with the efforts of patriotism, that they
would quickly have yielded obedience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certain it is, that though they had before
their eyes so many illustrious examples
in their mother country, of the constant success
attending firmness and perseverance in
opposition to dangerous encroachments on
liberty, yet they quietly gave up a point of
the last importance. From thence the decline
of their freedom began, and its decay
was extremely rapid; for as money was always
raised upon them by the parliament,
their assemblies grew immediately useless and
in a short time contemptible; and in less
than one hundred years, the people sunk
down into that tameness and supineness of
spirit by which they still continue to be distinguished."</p>

<h2><a name="LETTER_XI" id="LETTER_XI">LETTER XI.</a></h2>


<p>
<i>Beloved Countrymen,</i><br />
</p>

<p>I have several times, in the course of
these letters, mentioned the late act of
parliament, as being the foundation of future
measures injurious to these colonies;
and the belief of this truth I wish to prevail,
because I think it necessary to our
safety.</p>

<p>A perpetual jealousy respecting liberty,
is absolutely requisite in all free states.
The very texture of their constitution, in
mixt governments, demands it. For the
cautions with which power is distributed among
the several orders, imply, that each
has that share which is proper for the general
welfare, and therefore, that any further
imposition mull be pernicious.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>Machiavel
employs a whole chapter in his discourses,
to prove that a state, to be long lived, must
be frequently corrected, and reduced to its
first principles. But of all states that have
existed, there never was any, in which this
jealousy could be more proper than in these
colonies. For the government here is not
only mixt, but dependant, which circumstance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
occasions a peculiarity in its form, of
a very delicate nature.</p>

<p>Two reasons induce me to desire, that
this spirit of apprehension may be always
kept up among us, in its utmost vigilance.
The first is this, that as the happiness of these
provinces indubitably consists in their connection
with Great-Britain, any separation
between them is less likely to be occasioned
by civil discords, if every disgusting measure
is opposed singly, and while it is new:
for in this manner of proceeding, every such
measure is most likely to be rectified. On
the other hand, oppressions and dissatisfactions
being permitted to accumulate&mdash;if
ever the governed throw off the load, they
will do more. A people does not reform
with moderation. The rights of the subject
therefore cannot be too often considered,
explained, or asserted: and whoever
attempts to do this, shews himself, whatever
may be the rash and peevish reflections
of pretended wisdom, and pretended duty,
a friend to those who injudiciously exercise
their power, as well as to them, over whom
it is so exercised.</p>

<p>Had all the points of prerogative claimed
by Charles I. been separately contested and
settled in preceding reigns, his fate would
in all probability have been very different,
and the people would have been content with
that liberty which is compatible with regal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
authority. But<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> he thought, it would be as
dangerous for him to give up the powers
which at any time had been by usurpation exercised
by the crown, as those that were
legally vested in it. This produced an equal
excess on the part of the people. For when
their passions were excited by multiplied
grievances, they thought it would be as
dangerous for them, to allow the powers
that were legally vested in the crown, as
those which at any time had been by usurpation
exercised by it. Acts, that might
by themselves have been upon many considerations
excused or extenuated, derived a
contagious malignancy and odium from
other acts, with which they were connected.
They were not regarded according to the
simple force of each, but as parts of a
system of oppression. Every one therefore,
however small in itself, being alarming, as
an additional evidence of tyrannical designs.
It was in vain for prudent and moderate
men to insist, that there was no necessity to
abolish royalty. Nothing less than the utter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
destruction of monarchy, could satisfy those
who had suffered, and thought they had reason
to believe, they always should suffer under
it.</p>

<p>The consequences of these mutual distrusts
are well known: But there is no other
people mentioned in history, that I recollect,
who have been so constantly watchful of
their liberty, and so successful in their struggles
for it, as the English. This consideration
leads me to the second reason, why I
"desire that the spirit of apprehension may
be always kept up among us in its utmost
vigilance."</p>

<p>The first principles of government are to
be looked for in human nature. Some of
the best writers have asserted, and it seems
with good reason, that "government is
founded on<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>opinion."</p>

<p>Custom undoubtedly has a mighty force
in producing opinion, and reigns in nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
more arbitrarily than in public affairs. It
gradually reconciles us to objects even of
dread and detestation; and I cannot but
think these lines of Mr. Pope, as applicable
to vice in politics, as to vice in ethics.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Vice is a monster of so horrid mien,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As to be hated, needs but to be seen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We first endure, then pity, then embrace.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When an act injurious to freedom has been
once done, and the people bear it, the repetition
of it is most likely to meet with
submission. For as the mischief of the one
was found to be tolerable, they will hope
that of the second will prove so too; and
they will not regard the infamy of the last,
because they are stained with that of the
first.</p>

<p>Indeed, nations in general, are not apt
to think until they feel; and therefore nations
in general have lost their liberty: For
as violations of the rights of the governed,
are commonly not only specious,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> but small
at the beginning, they spread over the multitude
in such a manner, as to touch individuals
but slightly. Thus they are disregarded.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
The power or profit that arises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
from these violations, centering in few persons,
is to them considerable. For this reason
the governors having in view their particular
purposes, successively preserve an
uniformity of conduct for attaining them.
They regularly increase and multiply the
first injuries, till at length the inattentive
people are compelled to perceive the heaviness
of their burdens.&mdash;They begin to complain
and enquire&mdash;but too late.&mdash;They find
their oppressors so strengthened by success,
and themselves so entangled in examples of
express authority on the part of their rulers,
and of tacit recognition on their own part,
that they are quite confounded: For millions
entertain no other idea of the legality of
power, than that it is founded on the exercise
of power. They voluntarily fatten
their chains, by adopting a pusillanimous
opinion, "that there will be too much danger
in attempting a remedy," or another
opinion no less fatal, "that the government
has a right to treat them as it does."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
They then seek a wretched relief for their
minds, by persuading themselves, that to
yield their obedience is to discharge their
duty. The deplorable poverty of spirit,
that prostrates all the dignity bestowed by
divine providence on our nature&mdash;of course
succeeds.</p>

<p>From these reflections I conclude, that
every free State should incessantly watch, and
instantly take alarm on any condition being
made to the power exercised over them, innumerable
instances might be produced to
shew, from what slight beginnings the most
extensive consequences have flowed: but I
shall select two only from the history of
England.</p>

<p>Henry the seventh was the first monarch
of that kingdom, who established a standing
body of armed men. This was a band of
50 archers, called yeomen of the guard:
And this institution, notwithstanding the
smallness of the number, was, to prevent
discontent,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>"disguised under the pretence
of majesty and grandeur." In 1684, the
standing forces were so much augmented,
that Rapin says&mdash;"The King, in order to
make his people fully sensible of their new
slavery, affected to muster his troops, which
amounted to 4000 well armed and disciplined
men." I think our army, at this time,
consists of more than seventy regiments.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>
<p>The method of taxing by excise was first
introduced amidst the convulsions of civil
wars. Extreme necessity was pretended,
and its short continuance promised. After
the restoration, an excise upon beer, ale and
other liquors, was granted to the<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> King,
one half in fee, the other for life, as an equivalent
for the court of wards. Upon
James the second's accession, the parliament<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
gave him the first excise, with an additional
duty on wine, tobacco, and some
other things. Since the revolution it has
been extended to salt, candles, leather, hides,
hops, soap, paper, paste-board, mill-boards,
scaleboards, vellum, parchment, starch, silks,
calicoes, linens, stuffs, printed, stained, &amp;c.
wire, wrought plate, coffee, tea, chocolate,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>Thus a standing army and excise have,
from the first slender origins, tho' always
hated, always feared, always opposed, at
length swelled up to their vast present bulk.</p>

<p>These facts are sufficient to support what
I have said. 'Tis true that all the mischiefs
apprehended by our ancestors from a standing
army and excise, have not yet happened:
but it does not follow from thence,
that they will not happen. The inside of a
house may catch fire, and the most valuable
apartments be ruined, before the flames<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
burst out. The question in these cases is
not, what evil has actually attended particular
measures&mdash;but what evil, in the nature
of things, is likely to attend them. Certain
circumstances may for some time delay
effects, that were reasonably expected, and
that must ensue. There was a long period,
after the Romans had prorogued the command
to<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>Q. Publilius Philo, before that
example destroyed their liberty. All our
kings, from the revolution to the present
reign have been foreigners. Their ministers
generally continued but a short time in authority;<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
and they themselves were mild
and virtuous princes.</p>

<p>A bold, ambitious Prince, possessed of
great abilities, firmly fixed in the throne by
descent, served by ministers like himself, and
rendered either venerable or terrible by the
glory of his successes, may execute what his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
predecessors did not dare to attempt. Henry
IV. tottered in his seat during his whole
reign. Henry V. drew the strength of the
kingdom into France, to carry on his wars
there, and left the Commons at home, protesting,
"that the people were not bound
to serve out of the realm."</p>

<p>It is true, that a strong spirit of liberty
subsists at present in Great-Britain, but what
reliance is to be placed in the temper of a
people, when the prince is possessed of an unconstitutional
power, our own history can sufficiently
inform us. When Charles II. had
strengthened himself by the return of the
garrison of Tangier, "England (says Rapin)
saw on a sudden an amazing revolution; saw
herself stripped of all her rights and privileges,
excepting such as the King should
vouchsafe to grant her; and what is more
astonishing, the English themselves delivered
up these very rights and privileges to Charles
II. which they had so passionately, and,
if I may say it, furiously defended against the
designs of Charles I." This happened only
thirty-six years after this last prince had been
beheaded.</p>

<p>Some persons are of opinion, that liberty
is not violated, but by such open acts of
force; but they seem to be greatly mistaken.
I could mention a period within these
forty years, when almost as great a change
of disposition was produced by the secret
measures of a long administration, as by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
Charles's violence. Liberty, perhaps is never
exposed to so much danger, as when the
people believe there is the least; for it may
be subverted, and yet they not think so.</p>

<p>Public-disgusting acts are seldom practised
by the ambitious, at the beginning of their
designs. Such conduct silences and discourages
the weak, and the wicked, who would
otherways have been their advocates or accomplices.
It is of great consequence, to
allow those, who, upon any account, are inclined
to favour them, something specious to
say in their defence. The power may be
fully established, though it would not be safe
for them to do whatever they please. For
there are things, which, at some times, even
slaves will not bear. Julius Cæsar and Oliver
Cromwell did not dare to assume the
title of King. The grand Seignior dares not
lay a new tax. The King of France dares
not be a protestant. Certain popular points
may be left untouched, and yet freedom be
extinguished. The commonality of Venice imagine
themselves free, because they are
permitted to do, what they ought not. But
I quit a subject, that would lead me too far
from my purpose.</p>

<p>By the late act of parliament, taxes are to
be levied upon us, for "defraying the charge
of the administration of justice, the support of
civil government&mdash;and the expences of defending
his Majesty's dominions in America."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>If any man doubts what ought to be the
conduct of these colonies on this occasion, I
would ask them these questions.</p>

<p>Has not the parliament expressly avowed
their intention of raising money from us for
certain purposes? Is not this scheme popular
in Great-Britain? Will the taxes, imposed
by the late act, answer those purposes?
If it will, must it not take an immense sum
from us? If it will not, is it to be expected,
that the parliament will not fully execute
their intention, when it is pleasing at home,
and not opposed here? Must not this be done
by imposing new taxes? Will not every addition,
thus made to our taxes, be an addition
to the power of the British legislature, by
increasing the number of officers employed
in the collection? Will not every additional
tax therefore render it more difficult
to abrogate any of them? When a
branch of revenue is once established, does
it not appear to many people invidious and
undutiful, to attempt to abolish it? If taxes,
sufficient to accomplish the intention of
the Parliament, are imposed by the Parliament,
what taxes will remain to be imposed
by our assemblies? If no material taxes remain
to be imposed by them, what must become
of them, and the people they represent?
<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
"If any person considers, these things,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
and yet not thinks our liberties are in danger,
I wonder at that person's security."</p>

<p>One other argument is to be added,
which, by itself, I hope, will be sufficient
to convince the most incredulous man on this
continent, that the late act of Parliament is
only designed to be a precedent, whereon
the future vassalage of these colonies may be
established.</p>

<p>Every duty thereby laid on articles of
British manufacture, is laid on some commodity
upon the exportation of which from
Great-Britain, a drawback is payable. Those
drawbacks in most of the articles, are exactly
double to the duties given by the late
act. The Parliament therefore might in half
a dozen lines have raised much more money
only by stopping the drawbacks in the hands
of the officers at home, on exportation to
these colonies, than by this solemn imposition
of taxes upon us, to be collected here.
Probably, the artful contrivers of this act
formed it in this manner, in order to reserve
to themselves, in case of any objections being
made to it, this specious pretence&mdash;"That
the drawbacks are gifts to the colonies;
and that the act only lessens those
gifts." But the truth is, that the drawbacks
are intended for the encouragement
and promotion of British manufactures
and commerce, and are allowed on exportation
to any foreign parts, as well as on exportation
to these provinces. Besides, care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
has been taken to slide into the act<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> some articles
on which there are no drawbacks.
However, the whole duties laid by the late
act on all the articles therein specified, are
so small, that they will not amount to as
much as the drawbacks which are allowed
on part of them only. If, therefore, the
sum to be obtained by the late act had been
the sole object in forming it, there would
not have been any occasion for the "Commons
of Great-Britain to give and grant
to his Majesty, rates and duties for raising
a revenue in his Majesty's dominions in
America, for making a more certain and
adequate provision for defraying the
charge of the administration of justice,
the support of civil government, and the
expences of defending the said dominions"&mdash;&mdash;Nor
would there have been any
occasion for an<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>expensive board of commissioners,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>

the late act as an experiment made of our

such violence, are yet subsided. If this adventurer

<h2><a name="LETTER_XII" id="LETTER_XII">LETTER XII.</a></h2>


<p><i>Beloved Countrymen</i>,</p>

<p>Some states have lost their liberty by
particular accidents; but this calamity
is generally owing to the decay of virtue.
A people is travelling fast to destruction,
when individuals consider their interests as
distinct from those of the public. Such notions
are fatal to their country, and to themselves.
Yet how many are there so weak
and sordid as to think they perform all the
offices of life, if they earnestly endeavour
to increase their own wealth, power, and
credit, without the least regard for the society,
under the protection of which they live;
who, if they can make an immediate profit
to themselves, by lending their assistance
to those, whose projects plainly tend to the
injury of their country, rejoice in their dexterity,
and believe themselves intitled to
the character of able politicians. Miserable
men! of whom it is hard to say, whether
they ought to be most the objects of pity or
contempt, but whose opinions are certainly
as detestable as their practices are destructive.</p>

<p>Though I always reflect with a high pleasure
on the integrity and understanding of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
my countrymen, which, joined with a pure
and humble devotion to the great and gracious
author of every blessing they enjoy,
will, I hope, ensure to them, and their posterity,
all temporal and eternal happiness;
yet when I consider, that in every age and
country there have been bad men, my heart,
at this threatening period, is so full of apprehension,
as not to permit me to believe,
but that there may be some on this continent,
against whom you ought to be upon
your guard. Men, who either<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>hold or expect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
to hold certain advantages by setting
examples of servility to their countrymen&mdash;Men
who trained to the employment, or
self-taught by a natural versatility of genius,
serve as decoys for drawing the innocent
and unwary into snares. It is not to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
doubted but that such men will diligently
bestir themselves, on this and every like occasion,
to spread the infection of their meanness
as far as they can. On the plans they
have adopted, this is their course. This is
the method to recommend themselves to
their patrons.</p>

<p>They act consistently, in a bad cause.</p>

<p>They run well in a mean race.</p>

<p>From them we shall learn, how pleasant
and profitable a thing it is, to be, for our
submissive behaviour, well spoken of in St.
James's, or St. Stephen's; at Guildhall, or
the Royal Exchange. Specious fallacies
will be drest up with all the arts of delusion,
to persuade one colony to distinguish
herself from another, by unbecoming condescensions,
which will serve the ambitious
purpose of great men at home, and therefore
will be thought by them, to entitle their
assistants in obtaining them, to considerable
rewards.</p>

<p>Our fears will be excited; our hopes will
be awakened. It will be insinuated to us
with a plausible affectation of wisdom and
concern, how prudent it is to please the
powerful&mdash;how dangerous to provoke them&mdash;and
then comes in the perpetual incantation,
that freezes up every generous purpose
of the soul, in cold&mdash;inactive&mdash;expectation
"that if there is any request to be made,
compliance will obtain a favourable attention."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>Our vigilance and our union are success
and safety. Our negligence and our division
are distress and death. They are worse&mdash;they
are shame and slavery.</p>

<p>Let us equally shun the benumbing stillness
of overweening sloth, and the feverish
activity of that ill-informed zeal, which buries
itself in maintaining little, mean, and
narrow opinions. Let us, with a truly
wise generosity and charity, banish and discourage
all illiberal distinctions, which may
arise from differences in situation, forms of
government, or modes of religion. Let
us consider ourselves as men&mdash;Freemen&mdash;Christian
men&mdash;separated from the rest of
the world, and firmly bound together by
the same rights, interests, and dangers.
Let these keep our attention inflexibly fixed
on the great objects, which we must continually
regard, in order to preserve those
rights, to promote those interests, and to
avert those dangers.</p>

<p>Let these truths be indelibly impressed on
our minds&mdash;that we cannot be happy without
being free&mdash;that we cannot be free without
being secure in our property&mdash;that we
cannot be secure in our property, if, without
our consent, others may, as by right,
take it away&mdash;that taxes imposed on us by
parliament, do thus take it away&mdash;that duties
laid for the sole purposes of raising money,
are taxes&mdash;that attempts to lay such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
duties should be instantly and firmly opposed&mdash;that
this opposition can never be effectual,
unless it is the united effort of these
provinces&mdash;that, therefore, benevolence of
temper toward each other, and unanimity
of counsels are essential to the welfare of
the whole&mdash;and lastly, that, for this reason,
every man amongst us, who, in any manner,
would encourage either dissention, diffidence,
or indifference between these colonies, is an
enemy to himself and to his country.</p>

<p>The belief of these truths, I verily think,
my countrymen, is indispensably necessary
to your happiness. I beseech you, therefore,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
"Teach them diligently unto your
children, and talk of them when you sit
in your houses, and when you walk by
the way, and when you lie down, and
when you rise up."</p>

<p>What have these colonies to ask, while
they continue free? Or what have they to
dread, but insidious attempts to subvert
their freedom? Their prosperity does not
depend on ministerial favours doled out to
particular provinces. They form one political
body, of which each colony is a member.
Their happiness is founded on their
constitution; and is to be promoted by
preserving that constitution in unabated vigour
throughout every part. A spot, a
speck of decay, however small the limb on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
which it appears, and however remote it
may seem from the vitals, should be alarming.
We have all the rights requisite for
our prosperity. The legal authority of
Great-Britain may indeed lay hard restrictions
upon us; but, like the spear of Telephus,
it will cure as well as wound. Her
unkindness will instruct and compel us, after
some time, to discover, in our industry
and frugality, surprising remedies&mdash;if our
rights continue inviolated. For as long as
the products of our labours and the rewards
of our care, can properly be called our own,
so long will it be worth our while to be industrious
and frugal. But if when we plow&mdash;sow&mdash;reap&mdash;gather&mdash;and
thresh, we find,
that we plow&mdash;sow&mdash;reap&mdash;gather&mdash;and
thresh for others, whose pleasure is to be the
sole limitation, how much they shall take,
and how much they shall leave, why should
we repeat the unprofitable toil? Horses and
oxen are content with that portion of the
fruits of their work, which their owners assign
to them, in order to keep them strong
enough to raise successive crops; but even
these beasts will not submit to draw for their
masters, until they are subdued with whips
and goads. Let us take care of our rights,
and we therein take care of our property.
"Slavery is ever preceded by sleep."<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> Individuals
may be dependant on ministers, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
they please. States should scorn it&mdash;&mdash;And,
if you are not wanting to yourselves, you
will have a proper regard paid you by those,
to whom if you are not respectable, you will
infallibly be contemptible. But if we have
already forgot the reasons that urged us,
with unexampled unanimity, to exert ourselves
two years ago; if our zeal for the public
good is worn out before the homespun
cloaths which it caused us to have made&mdash;if
our resolutions are so faint, as by our
present conduct to condemn our own late
successful example&mdash;&mdash;if we are not affected
by any reverence for the memory of our ancestors,
who transmitted to us that freedom
in which they had been blest&mdash;&mdash;if we are
not animated by any regard for posterity,
to whom, by the most sacred obligations,
we are bound to deliver down the invaluable
inheritance&mdash;Then, indeed, any minister&mdash;or
any tool of a minister&mdash;or any
creature of a tool of a minister&mdash;or any
lower<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>instrument of administration, if lower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
there may be, is a personage, whom it
may be dangerous to offend.</p>

<p>I shall be extremely sorry if any man mistakes
my meaning in any thing I have said.
Officers employed by the crown, are, while
according to the laws they conduct themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
entitled to legal obedience and sincere
respect. These it is a duty to render them,
and these no good or prudent person will
withhold. But when these officers, thro'
rashness or design, endeavour to enlarge
their authority beyond its due limits, and expect
improper concessions to be made to
them, from regard for the employments they
bear, their attempts should be considered as
equal injuries to the crown and people, and
should be courageously and constantly opposed.
To suffer our ideas to be confounded
by names, on such occasions, would certainly
be an inexcusable weakness, and probably,
an irremediable error.</p>

<p>We have reason to believe, that several
of his Majesty's present ministers are good
men, and friends to our country; and it
seems not unlikely, that by a particular concurrence
of events, we have been treated
a little more severely than they wished we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
should be. They might not think it prudent
to stem a torrent. But what is the
difference to us, whether arbitrary acts
take their rise from ministers, or are permitted
by them? Ought any point to be
allowed to a good<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> minister, that should
be denied to a bad one? The mortality of
ministers is a very frail mortality. A * * *
may succeed a Shelburne&mdash;a * * * may succeed
a Conway.</p>

<p>We find a new kind of minister lately spoken
of at home&mdash;&mdash;"The minister of the
house of Commons." The term seems
to have particular propriety when referred
to these colonies, with a different meaning
annexed to it, from that in which it is taken
there. By the word "minister" we
may understand not only a servant of the
crown, but a man of influence among the
Commons, who regard themselves as having
a share of the sovereignty over us. The minister
of the house may, in a point respecting
the colonies, be so strong, that the minister
of the crown in the house, if he is a distinct
person, may not chuse, even where his
sentiments are favourable to us, to come to
a pitched battle upon our account. For tho'
I have the highest opinion of the deference
of the house for the King's minister; yet he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
may be so good natured as not to put it to the
test, except it be for the mere and immediate
profit of his master or himself.</p>

<p>But whatever kind of minister he is, that
attempts to innovate a single iota in the privileges
of these colonies, him I hope you will
undauntedly oppose, and that you will never
suffer yourselves to be either cheated or
frightened into any unworthy obsequiousness.
On such emergencies you may surely without
presumption believe that ALMIGHTY
GOD himself will look down upon your
righteous contest with gracious approbation.
You will be a "Band of brother's" cemented
by the dearest ties&mdash;and strengthened with
inconceivable supplies of force and constancy,
by that sympathetic ardour which animates
good men, confederated in a good cause.
Your honour and welfare will be, as they
now are, most intimately concerned; and
besides&mdash;&mdash;you are assigned by Divine Providence,
in the appointed order of things, the
protectors of unborn ages, whose fate depends
upon your virtue. Whether they shall
arise the noble and indisputable heirs of the
richest patrimonies, or the dastardly and hereditary
drudges of imperious task-masters,
you must determine.</p>

<p>To discharge this double duty to yourselves
and to your posterity; you have nothing to
do, but to call forth into use the good sense
and spirit, of which you are possessed. You
have nothing to do, but to conduct your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
affairs peaceably&mdash;&mdash;prudently&mdash;&mdash;firmly&mdash;&mdash;jointly.
By these means you will
support the character of freemen, without
losing that of faithful subjects&mdash;a good character
in any government&mdash;one of the best
under a British government. You will prove
that Americans have that true magnanimity
of soul, that can resent injuries without falling
into rage; and that tho' your devotion to
Great-Britain is the most affectionate, yet
you can make proper distinctions, and know
what you owe to yourselves as well as to her&mdash;&mdash;you
will, at the same time that you advance
your interests, advance your reputation&mdash;you
will convince the world of the justice
of your demands, and the purity of your
intentions&mdash;while all mankind must with unceasing
applauses confess, that you indeed
deserve liberty, who so well understand it,
so passionately love it, so temperately enjoy
it, and so wisely, bravely, and virtuously, assert,
maintain, and defend it.</p>

<p>When the rights and liberties of the
numerous and loyal inhabitants of this
extensive continent are in imminent danger,&mdash;when
the inveterate enemies of these colonies
are not more assiduous to forge fetters
for them, than diligent to delude the people,
and zealous to persuade them to an indolent
acquiescence: At this alarming period, when
to reluct is deemed a revolt, and to oppose
such measures as are injudicious and destructive,
is construed as a formal attempt to subvert
order and government; when to reason
is to rebel; and a ready submission to the
rod of power, is sollicited by the tenders of
place and patronage, or urged by the menace
of danger and disgrace: 'Tis to YOU,
worthy <span class="smcap">Sir</span>, that <span class="smcap">America</span> is obliged, for
a most seasonable, sensible, loyal, and vigorous
vindication of her invaded rights and
liberties: 'Tis to YOU, the distinguished honour
is due; that when many of the friends
of liberty were ready to fear its utter subversion:
Armed with truth, supported by the
immutable laws of nature, the common inheritance
of man, and leaning on the pillars
of the <span class="smcap">British</span> constitution; you seasonably
brought your aid, opposed impending ruin,
awakened the most indolent and inactive, to
a sense of danger, re-animated the hopes of
those, who had before exerted themselves
in the cause of freedom, and instructed <span class="smcap">America</span>
in the best means to obtain redress.</p>

<p>Nor is this western world alone indebted
to your wisdom, fortitude, and patriotism:
<span class="smcap">Great-Britain</span> also may be confirmed
by you, that to be truly great
and successful, she must be just: That to
oppress <span class="smcap">America</span>, is to violate her own
honours, defeat her brightest prospects, and
contract her spreading empire.</p>

<p>To such eminent worth and virtue, the
inhabitants of the town of <span class="smcap">Boston</span>, the
capital of the province of the <span class="smcap">Massachusetts-Bay</span>,
in full town meeting assembled,
express their earliest gratitude. Actuated
themselves by the same generous principles,
which appear with so much lustre in your
useful labours, they will not fail warmly to
recommend, and industriously to promote
that union among the several colonies, which
is so indispensably necessary for the security
of the whole.</p>

<p>Tho' such superior merit must assuredly,
in the closest recess, enjoy the divine satisfaction
of having served, and possibly saved
this people; tho' veiled from our view,
you modestly shun the deserved applause of
millions; permit us to intrude upon your
retirement, and salute The FARMER, as

<p>
The 12th Cha. II Chap. 18, which forms the foundation
of the laws relating to our trade, by enacting that
certain productions of the colonies shall be carried to
England only, and that no goods shall be imported from
the plantations but in ships belonging to England, Ireland,
Wales, Berwick, or the Plantations, &amp;c. begins
thus: "For the increase of shipping, and encouragement
of the navigation of this nation, wherein, under
the good providence and protection of God, the wealth,
safety, and strength of this kingdom is so much
concerned," &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
The 15th Cha. II. Chap. 7. enforcing the same regulation,
assigns these reasons for it. "In regard to his
Majesty's plantations, beyond the seas, are inhabited and
peopled by his subjects of this his kingdom of England;
for the maintaining a greater correspondence and kindness
between them, and keeping them in a firmer dependence
upon it, and rendering them yet more beneficial
and advantageous unto it, in the further employment
and increase of English shipping and seamen, vent
of English woolen, and other manufactures and commodities,
rendering the navigation to and from the
same more safe and cheap, and making this kingdom a
staple, not only of the commodities of those plantations,
but also of the commodities of other countries
and places for the supplying of them; and it being the
usage of other nations to keep their plantations trade
to themselves," &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
The 25th Cha. II. Chap. 7, made expressly "for the
better securing the plantation trade," which imposes
duties on certain commodities exported from one colony
to another, mentions this last for imposing them:
"Whereas by one act passed in the 12th year of your
Majesty's reign, intitled, an act for encouragement of
shipping and navigation, and by several other laws, passed
since that time, it is permitted to ship, &amp;c. sugars,
tobacco, &amp;c. of the growth, &amp;c. of any of your Majesty's
plantations in America &amp;c. from the places of
their growth, &amp;c. to any other of your Majesty's plantations
in those parts, &amp;c. and that without paying of
custom for the same, either at the lading or unlading
the said commodities, by means whereof the trade
and navigation in those commodities from one plantation
to another is greatly encreased, and the inhabitants
of divers of those colonies, not contenting themselves
with being supplied with those commodities for
their own use, free from all customs (while the subjects of
this your kingdom of England have paid great customs
and impositions for what of them hath been spent here)
but, contrary to the express letter of the aforesaid laws,
have brought into diverse parts of Europe great quantities
thereof, and do also vend great quantities thereof
to the shipping of other nations, who bring them into
divers parts of Europe, to the great hurt and diminution
of your Majesty's customs, and of the trade and navigation
of this your kingdom; for the prevention
thereof, &amp;c."
</p>
<p>
The 7th and 8th Will. III. Chap. 21, intitled, "An
act for preventing frauds, and regulating abuses in
the plantation trade," recites that, "notwithstanding
diverse acts, &amp;c. great abuses are daily committed, to
the prejudice of the English navigation, and the loss of
a great part of the plantation trade to this kingdom, by
the artifice and cunning of ill disposed persons: for remedy
whereof, &amp;c. And whereas in some of his Majesty's
American plantations, a doubt or misconstruction
has arisen upon the before mentioned acts, made in the
25th year of the reign of Charles II. whereby certain
duties are laid upon the commodities therein enumerated
(which by law may be transported from one
plantation to another, for the supplying of each others
wants) as if the same were, by the payment of those
duties in one plantation, discharged from giving the securities
intended by the aforesaid acts, made in the 12th,
22d and 23d years of the reign of King Charles II. and
consequently be at liberty to go to any foreign market
in Europe," &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
The 6th Anne, Chap. 37, reciting the advancement of
trade, &amp;c. and encouragement of ships of war, &amp;c. grants
to the captors the property of all prizes carried into America,
subject to such customs and duties, &amp;c. as if the
same had been first imported into any part of Great-Britain,
and from thence exported, &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
This was a gift to persons acting under commissions
from the crown, and therefore it was reasonable that the
terms prescribed should be complied with&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;more
especially as the payment of such duties was intended
to give a preference to the productions of the British
colonies, over those of other colonies. However, being
found inconvenient to the colonies, about four years afterwards,
this act was, for that reason, so far repealed,
by another act "all prize goods, imported into any
part of Great-Britain, from any of the plantations,
were liable to such duties only in Great-Britain,
as in case they had been of the growth and produce of
the plantations," &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
The 6th Geo. II. Chap. 13, which imposes duties on
foreign rum, sugar and molasses, imported into the colonies,
shews the reason thus.&mdash;"Whereas the welfare
and prosperity of your Majesty's sugar colonies in America,
are of the greatest consequence and importance to
the trade, navigation and strength of this kingdom;
and whereas the planters of the said sugar colonies, have
of late years fallen under such great discouragements
that they are unable to improve or carry on the sugar
trade, upon an equal footing with the foreign sugar
colonies, without some advantage and relief be given to
them from Great-Britain: For remedy whereof, and
for the good and welfare of your Majesty's subjects," &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
The 29th Geo. II. Chap. 26. and the 1st Geo. III. Chap.
9, which contains 6th Geo. II. Chap. 13, declare,
that the said act hath, by experience, been found useful
and beneficial, &amp;c. There are all the most considerable
statutes relating to the commerce of the colonies; and
it is thought to be utterly unnecessary to add any observations
to these extracts, to prove that they were all intended
solely as regulations of trade.</p></div>

they still carefully guarded against the establishment of
illegal services. Lord Chief Justice Coke's words are
these, "When this point concerning maintainance of
wars out of England came in question, the Commons did
make their continual claim of their antient freedom and
birth-right, as in the first of Henry V. and 7th of Henry
V. &amp;c. the Commons made protest that they were
not bound to the maintainance of war in Scotland, Ireland,
Calais, France, Normandy, or other foreign parts,
and caused their protests to be entered into the parliament
roll, where they yet remain; which, in effect, agreeth
with that, which upon the like occasion was made
in the parliament of 25. E. 1." 2d Inst. p. 528.</p></div>

of America, during the debate concerning the repeal of
the Stamp-act, by "<em>internal taxes</em>" meant any duties
"<em>for the purpose of raising a revenue</em>;" and by "<em>external
taxes</em>," meant "<em>duties imposed for the regulation of trade</em>."
His expressions are these.&mdash;"If the gentleman does not
understand the difference between internal and external
taxes, I cannot help it; but there is a plain distinction
between taxes levied for the purposes of raising a revenue,
and duties imposed for the regulation of trade, for
the accommodation of the subject; altho' in the consequences,
some revenue might incidentally arise from
the latter."
</p>
<p>
These words were in Mr. Pitt's reply to Mr. Grenville,
who said he could not understand the difference between
external and internal taxes. But Mr. Pitt in his first
speech, had made no such distinction; and his meaning,
when he mentions the distinction, appears to be&mdash;that
by "<em>external taxes</em>," he intended impositions, for the
purpose of regulating the intercourse of the colonies
with others; and by "<em>internal taxes</em>," he intended impositions,
for the purpose of taking money from them.
</p>
<p>
In every other part of his speeches on that occasion,
his words confirm this construction of his expressions.
The following extracts will shew how positive and general
were his assertions of our right.
</p>
<p>
"<span class="smcap">It is my opinion that this kingdom has no
right to lay a tax upon the colonies.</span>" "<span class="smcap">The
Americans are the sons not the bastards of
England. Taxation is no part of the Governing
or legislative power.</span>" "The taxes are a voluntary
gift and grant of the Commons alone. In legislation
the three estates of the realm are alike concerned,
but the concurrence of the peers and the crown to a
tax, is only necessary to close with the form of a law.
The gift and grant is of the Commons alone." "The
distinction between legislation and taxation is essentially
necessary to liberty." "<em>The Commons of America represented
in their several assemblies have ever been in possession of
the exercise of this, their constitutional right, of giving and
granting their own money. They would have been slaves, if
they had not enjoyed it.</em>" "The idea of a virtual representation
of America in this house, is the most contemptible
idea that ever entered into the head of man. It
does not deserve a serious refutation."
</p>
<p>
He afterwards shews the unreasonableness of Great-Britain
taxing America, thus&mdash;"When I had the honour
of serving his Majesty, I availed myself of the
means of information, which I derived from my office:
I speak therefore from knowledge. My materials were
good, I was at pains to collect, to digest, to consider
them: <em>and I will be bold to affirm that the profit to Great-Britain
from the trade of the colonies, thro' all its branches,
is two millions a year. This is the fund that carried you triumphantly
thro' the last war.</em> The estates that were rented
at two thousand pounds a year, threescore years ago,
are at three thousand pounds at present. Those estates sold
then from fifteen to eighteen years purchase; the same
may now be sold for thirty. YOU OWE THIS TO AMERICA.
THIS IS THE PRICE THAT AMERICA
PAYS YOU FOR HER PROTECTION,"&mdash;"I dare
not say how much higher these profits may be augmented."&mdash;"Upon
the whole, I will beg leave to tell the
house what is really my opinion: it is, <small>THAT THE
STAMP-ACT BE REPEALED ABSOLUTELY, TOTALLY,
AND IMMEDIATELY</small>. That the reason for the repeal be
assigned, because it was founded on an erroneous principle."</p></div>

of all kinds, or such product where there is little got by
the improvement, as malt, salt, beef and pork; indeed
the exportation of salt fish thither would be more advantageous,
but the goods which we send to the northern
colonies are such, whose improvement may be justly

"New-England is the most prejudicial plantation to
the kingdom of England; and yet, to do right to that
most industrious English colony, I must confess, that
though we lose by their unlimited trade with other
foreign plantations, yet we are very great gainers by
their direct trade to and from Old England. Our yearly
exportations of English manufactures, malt and other
goods, from hence thither, amounting, in my opinion,
to ten times the value of what is imported from thence;
which calculation I do not make at random, but upon
mature consideration, and peradventure, upon as much
experience in this very trade, as any other person will
pretend to; and therefore, whenever reformation of
our correspondency in trade with that people shall be
thought on, it will, in my poor judgment, require
great tenderness, and very serious circumspection."

England, must be meant chiefly of the continental colonies.

"I shall sum up my whole remarks on our American
colonies, with this observation, that as they are a certain
annual revenue of several millions sterling to their

were few, and those but indifferent; the number
of English merchants very small, and the whole
shipping of the nation much inferior to what now belongs
to the northern colonies only. These are certain
facts. But since their establishment, our condition has
altered for the better, almost to a degree beyond credibility.
Our manufactures are prodigiously encreased,
chiefly by the demand for them in the plantations,
where they at least take off one half, and supply us
with many valuable commodities for exportation, which
is as great an emolument to the mother kingdom, as to
the plantations themselves."

"The inhabitants of our colonies, by carrying on a

a greater quantity of the goods and merchandizes
of Europe being sent from hence to them, and a greater
quantity of the product of America to be sent from
them thither, which would otherways be carried from,
and brought to Europe by foreigners, but an increase
of the seamen and navigation in those parts, which is
of great strength and security, as well as of great advantage
to our plantations in general. And though
some of our colonies are not only for preventing the
importations of all goods of the same species they produce,
but suffer particular planters to keep great runs
of land in their possession uncultivated with design to
prevent new settlements, whereby they imagine the
prices of their commodities may be affected; yet if it
be considered, that the markets of Great-Britain depend
on the markets of all Europe in general, and that the
European markets in general depend on the proportion
between the annual consumption and the whole quantity
of each species annually produced by all nations; it
must follow, that whether we or foreigners, are the
producers, carriers, importers and exporters of American
produce, yet their respective prices in each colony (the
difference of freight, customs and importations considered)
will always bear proportion to the general consumption
of the whole quantity of each sort, produced

were called chimerical and dangerous. Afterwards many
malignant suggestions were made, about sacrificing
so many Englishmen to the obstinate desire of settling
colonies in countries which then produced very
little advantage. But as these difficulties were gradually
surmounted, those complaints vanished. No sooner were
these lamentations over, but others arose in their stead;
when it could be no longer said, that the colonies were
useless, it was alledged that they were not useful enough
to their mother country; that while we were loaded

nails. Wine, paper, linens, and a thousand other things

way, which only can be in property and dominion.
Upon which score, any innovations in the form of
government there, should be cautiously examined, for
fear of entering upon measures, by which the industry
of the inhabitants may be quite discouraged. 'Tis
always unfortunate for a people, either by consent or

<p>
All wise states will well consider how to preserve
the advantages arising from colonies, and avoid the
evils. And I conceive that there can be but two ways
in nature to hinder them from throwing off their dependence;
one to keep it out of their power, and the
other, out of their will. The first must be by force;
and the latter by using them well, and keeping them
employed in such productions, and making such manufactures,
as will support themselves and families comfortably,
and procure them wealth too, and at least
not prejudice their mother country.
</p>
<p>
Force can never be used effectually to answer the end,
without destroying the colonies themselves. Liberty
and encouragement are necessary to carry people thither,
and to keep them together when they are there; and
violence will hinder both. Any body of troops considerable
enough to awe them, and keep them in subjection,
under the direction too of a needy governor,
often sent thither to make his fortune, and at such a
distance from any application for redress, will soon put
an end to all planting, and leave the country to the
soldiers alone, and if it did not, would eat up all the
profit of the colony. For this reason, arbitrary countries
have not been equally successful in planting colonies
with free ones; and what they have done in that kind,
has either been by force at a vast expence, or by departing
from the nature of their government, and giving
such privileges to planters as were denied to their other
subjects. And I dare say, that a few prudent laws, and
a little prudent conduct, would soon give us far the
greatest share of the riches of all America, perhaps
drive many of other nations out of it, or into our colonies
for shelter.
</p>
<p>
There are so many exigencies in all states, so many
foreign wars and domestic disturbances, that these colonies
can never want opportunities, if they watch for
them, to do what they shall find their interest to do;
and therefore we ought to take all the precautions in
our power, that it shall never be their interest to act
against that of their native country; an evil which
can no otherways be averted, than by keeping them
fully employed in such trades as will increase their own,
as well as our wealth; for it is much to be feared, if
we do not find employment for them, they may find it
for us. The interest of the mother country is always
to keep them dependent, and so employed; and it requires
all her address to do it; and it is certainly more
easily and effectually done by gentle and insensible methods,
than by power alone.

That it being doubtful whether the intention of the
4th Geo. III. ch. 15, was not as much to regulate trade
as to raise a revenue, the minds of the people here
were wholly engrossed by the terror of the Stamp-act,
then impending over them, about the intention of
which they could be in no doubt.'
</p>
<p>
'These reasons so far distinguish 4th Geo. III. ch. 15,
from the last act, that it is not to be wondered at, that
the first should have been submitted to, though the last
should excite the most universal and spirited opposition.
For this will be found on the strictest examination
to be, in the principle on which it is founded, and
in the consequences that must attend it, if possible,
more destructive than the Stamp-act. It is, to speak
plainly, a prodigy in our laws, not having one British
feature.'</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_31_31" id="Footnote_31_31"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31_31"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> Many remarkable instances might be produced of
the extraordinary inattention with which bills of great
importance, concerning these colonies, have passed in
parliament; which is owing, as it is supposed, to the
bills being brought in by the persons who have points to
carry, so artfully framed, that it is not easy for the
members in general, in the haste of business, to discover
their tendency.
</p>
<p>
The following instances shew the truth of this remark.
When Mr. Grenville, in the violence of reformation
and innovation, formed the 4th Geo. III. chap. 15th,
for regulating the American trade, the word "Ireland"
was dropt in the clause relating to our iron and lumber,
so that we could send these articles to no other part
of Europe, but to Great-Britain. This was so unreasonable
a restriction, and so contrary to the sentiments of
the legislature, for many years before, that it is surprising
it should not have been taken notice of in the house.
However the bill passed into a law. But when the matter
was explained, this restriction was taken off in a subsequent
act.
</p>
<p>
I cannot postively say, how long after the taking off
this restriction, as I have not the acts; but I think in less
than eighteen months, another act of parliament passed,
in which the word "Ireland," was left out as it had
been before. The matter being a second time explained,
was a second time regulated.
</p>
<p>
Now if it be considered, that the omission mentioned
struck off, with one word, so very great a part of our
trade, it must appear remarkable: and equally so is the
method by which rice became an enumerated commodity,
and therefore could be carried to Great-Britain only.
</p>
<p>
"The enumeration was obtained, (says Mr. Gee*) by
one Cole, a Captain of a ship, employed by a company
then trading to Carolina; for several ships going from
England thither and purchasing rice for Portugal, prevented
the aforesaid Captain of a loading. Upon his
coming home, he possessed one Mr. Lowndes, a member
of parliament (who was very frequently employed to
prepare bills) with an opinion, that carrying rice directly
to Portugal was a prejudice to the trade of England,
and privately got a clause into an act to make it an enumerated
commodity; by which means he secured a
freight to himself. But the consequence proved a vast
loss to the nation."

<p><a name="Footnote_35_35" id="Footnote_35_35"></a><a href="#FNanchor_35_35"><span class="label">[35]</span></a> This is the opinion of Mr. Pitt, in his speech on
the Stamp-act.
</p>
<p>
"It is my opinion, that this kingdom has no right to
lay a tax upon the colonies. The <span class="smcap">Americans</span> are the
SONS, not the BASTARDS of <span class="smcap">England</span>. The distinction
between legislation and taxation is essentially
necessary to liberty. The Commons of America represented
in their several assemblies, have ever been
in possession of this their constitutional right of giving
and granting their own money. They would
have been slaves if they had not enjoyed it. The idea
of a virtual representation of America, in this
house, is the most contemptible idea that ever entered
into the head of man. It does not deserve a serious
refutation."
</p>
<p>
That great and excellent man Lord Cambden, maintains
the same opinion in his speech, in the house of
peers, on the declaratory bill of the sovereignty of Great-Britain
over the colonies. The following extracts so
perfectly agree with, and confirm the sentiments avowed
in these letters, that it is hoped the inserting them in
this note will be excused.
</p>
<p>
"As the affair is of the utmost importance, and in its
consequences may involve the fate of kingdoms, I took
the strictest review of my arguments; I re-examined
all my authorities; fully determined, if I found myself
mistaken, publicly to own my mistake, and give up
my opinion, but my searches have more and more
convinced me, that the British parliament have no
right to tax the Americans. Nor is the doctrine new;
it is as old as the constitution; it grew up with it,
indeed it is its support. Taxation and representation
are inseparably united. God hath joined them; no
British parliament can separate them; to endeavour
to do it is to stab our vitals.
</p>
<p>
"My position is this&mdash;I repeat it&mdash;I will maintain it
to my last hour&mdash;Taxation and representation are inseparable.
This position is founded on the laws of
nature; it is more, it is itself an eternal law of nature;
for whatever is a man's own, is absolutely his
own; and no man hath a right to take it from him
without his consent, either expressed by himself or
representative; whoever attempts to do it, attempts
an injury; whoever does it, commits a robbery; he
throws down the distinction between liberty and slavery."
"There is not a blade of grass, in the most
obscure corner of the kingdom, which is not, which
was not, represented since the constitution began:
there is not a blade of grass, which when taxed, was
not taxed by the consent of the proprietor." "The
forefathers of the Americans did not leave their native
country, and subject themselves to every danger
and distress, to be reduced to the state of slavery. They
did not give up their rights; they looked for protection,
and not for chains, from their mother-country.
By her they expected to be defended in the possession of
their property; and not to be deprived of it: For should
the present power continue, there is nothing which
they can call their own, or, to use the words of Mr.
Locke, what property have they in that, which another
may, by right, take, when he pleases, to him
self."
</p>
<p>
It is impossible to read this speech and Mr. Pitt's, and
not be charmed with the generous zeal for the rights of
mankind, that glows in every sentence. These great
and good men, animated by the subject they speak upon,
seem to rise above all the former glorious exertions
of their abilities. A foreigner might be tempted to
think they are Americans, asserting with all the ardour
of patriotism, and all the anxiety of apprehension, the
cause of their native land, and not Britons striving to
stop their mistaken countrymen from oppressing others.

<p><a name="Footnote_42_42" id="Footnote_42_42"></a><a href="#FNanchor_42_42"><span class="label">[42]</span></a> In Charles II's time, the House of Commons, influenced
by some factious demagogues, were resolved to
prohibit the importation of Irish cattle into England.
Among other arguments in favour of Ireland, it was insisted
"That by cutting off almost entirely the trade
between the kingdoms, all the natural bands of union
were dissolved, and nothing remained to keep the Irish
in their duty, but force and violence.
</p>
<p>
"The King (says Mr. Hume in his History of England)
was so convinced of the justice of these reasons, that
he used all his interest to oppose the bill, and he openly
declared, that he could not give his assent to it
with a safe conscience. But the Commons were resolute
in their purpose. And the spirit of tyranny, of
which nations are as susceptible as individuals, had
animated the English extremely to exert their superiority
over their dependant state. No affair could be
conducted with greater violence that this, by the
Commons. They even went so far in the preamble
of the bill, as to declare the importation of Irish cattle
to be a nuisance. By this expression they gave
scope to their passion, and at the same time, barred
the King's prerogative, by which he might think himself
intitled to dispense with a law so full of injustice
and bad policy. The lords expunged the word, but
as the King was sensible that no supply would be given
by the Commons, unless they were gratified in all
their prejudices, he was obliged both to employ his
interest with the Peers to make the bill pass, and to
give the Royal assent to it. He could not however forbear
expressing his displeasure, at the jealousy entertained
against him, and at the intention which the
Commons discovered of retrenching his prerogative."
</p>
<p>
This law brought great distress for sometime upon Ireland,
but it occasioned their applying with great industry
to manufactures, and has proved, in the issue, beneficial
to that kingdom.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the same reason occasioned the "barring the
King's prerogative" in the late act suspending the legislation
of New-York.
</p>
<p>
This we may be assured of, that we are as dear to his
Majesty, as the people of Great-Britain are. We are his
subjects as well as they, and as faithful subjects; and
his Majesty has given too many, too constant proofs of his
piety and virtue, for any man, to think it possible, that
such a Prince can make any unjust distinction between
such subjects. It makes no difference to his Majesty,
whether supplies are raised in Great-Britain, or America:
but it makes some difference, to the Commons of
that kingdom.
</p>
<p>
To speak plainly as becomes an honest man on such
important occasions, all our misfortunes are owing to a
lust of power in men of abilities and influence. This
prompts them to seek popularity, by expedients profitable
to themselves, though ever so destructive to their
country.
</p>
<p>
Such is the accursed nature of lawless ambition, and
yet&mdash;what heart but melts at the thought?&mdash;Such false
detestable patriots in every nation have led their blind
confiding country, shouting their applauses, into the
jaws of shame and ruin. May the wisdom and goodness
of the people of Great-Britain, save them from the usual
fate of nations.</p></div>

was presented to the House of Commons in Great-Britain,
setting forth, "that herrings were imported
into Ireland, from some foreign parts of the north so
cheap, as to discourage the British herring fishery,
and therefore praying, that some remedy might be
applied in that behalf by parliament"&mdash;"That, upon
this petition, the House resolved to impose a duty of
two shillings sterling on every barrel of foreign herrings
imported into Ireland, but afterwards dropt the
affair, for fear of engaging in a dispute with Ireland
about the right of taxing her."
</p>
<p>
So much higher was the opinion, which the House
entertained of the spirit of Ireland, than of that of these
colonies.
</p>
<p>
I find in the last English papers, that the resolution
and firmness with which the people of that kingdom
have lately asserted their freedom, have been so alarming
in Great-Britain, that the Lord Lieutenant in his
speech on the 20th of last October, "recommended" to
the parliament, "that such provision may be made for
securing the judges in the enjoyment of their offices
and appointments during their good behaviour, as
shall be thought most expedient."

employed in the collection of the revenue in every

of placemen, and candidates for places in the
customs, in the excise, in the post-office, in the
dock-yards, in the ordnance, in the salt-office, in

the endless dependance created by the obligations

or not, is not so much to be considered by others, in the
judgment they form of these gentlemen, as whether
they think they ought to be regarded. Perhaps, therefore
we shall act in the properest manner towards them,
if we neither reproach nor imitate them. The persons
meant in this letter, are the base-spirited wretches, who
may endeavor to distinguish themselves, by their sordid
zeal, in defending and promoting measures, which they
know, beyond all question, to be destructive to the just
rights and true interests of their country. It is scarcely
possible, to speak of these men with any degree of
patience. It is scarcely possible to speak of them with
any degree of propriety. For no words can truly describe
their guilt, and meanness. But every honest man,
on their being mentioned, will feel what cannot be expressed.
If their wickedness did not blind them, they
might perceive, along the coast of these colonies, many
skeletons of wretched ambition; who after distinguishing
themselves, in support of the Stamp-act, by a couragious
contempt of their country, and of justice,
have been left to linger out their miserable existence,
without a government, collectorship, secretaryship, or
any other commission to console them, as well as it could
for loss of virtue and reputation&mdash;while numberless offices
have been bestowed in these colonies, on people
from Great-Britain, and new ones are continually invented
to be thus bestowed. As a few great prizes are
put into a lottery to tempt multitudes to lose, so here
and there an American has been raised to a good post&mdash;

Mr. Grenville, indeed, in order to recommend the
Stamp-act, had the unequalled generosity, to pour
down a golden shower of offices upon Americans; and
yet these ungrateful colonies did not thank Mr. Grenville
for shewing his kindness to their countrymen, nor
them for accepting it. How must that great statesman
have been surprised to find, that the unpolished colonists
could not be reconciled to infamy, by treachery? Such
a bountiful disposition towards us never appeared in any
minister before him, and probably never will appear
again. For it is evident that such a system of policy is
to be established on this continent, as, in a short time, is
to render it utterly unnecessary to use the least art in
order to conciliate our approbation of any measures.
Some of our countrymen may be employed to fix chains
upon us; but they will never be permitted to hold them
afterwards. So that the utmost that any of them can
expect, is only a temporary provision, that may expire
in their own time; but which, they may be assured,
will preclude their children from having any consideration
paid to them. The natives of America, will sink
into total neglect and contempt, the moment that their
country loses the constitutional powers she now possesses.
Most sincerely do I wish and pray, that every one
of us may be convinced of this great truth, that industry
and integrity are the "paths of pleasantness, which
lead to happiness."</p></div>

If any person shall imagine that he discovers in these
letters the least disaffection towards our most excellent
Sovereign, and the parliament of Great-Britain; or the
least dislike to the dependance of these colonies on that
kingdom, I beg that such person will not form any judgment
on particular expressions, but will consider the tenour
of all the letters taken together. In that case, I
flatter myself that every unprejudiced reader will be
convinced, that the true interests of Great-Britain are as
dear to me as they ought to be to every good subject.
</p>
<p>
If I am an Enthusiast in anything, it is in my zeal for
the perpetual dependance of these colonies on their mother-country.&mdash;A
dependance founded on mutual benefits,
the continuance of which can be secured only by
mutual affections. Therefore it is, that with extreme
apprehension I view the smallest seeds of discontent,
which are unwarily scattered abroad. Fifty or sixty
years will make astonishing alterations in these colonies;
and this consideration should render it the business of
Great Britain more and more to cultivate our good dispositions
towards her: but the misfortune is, that those
great men, who are wrestling for power at home, think
themselves very slightly interested in the prosperity of
their country fifty or sixty years hence; but are deeply
concerned in blowing up a popular clamour for supposed
immediate advantages.
</p>
<p>
For my part, I regard Great-Britain as a bulwark happily
fixed between these colonies and the powerful nations
of Europe. That kingdom is our advanced post or fortification,
which remaining safe, we under its protection enjoying
peace, may diffuse the blessings of religion, science,
and liberty, thro' remote wildernesses. It is, therefore, incontestibly
our duty and our interest, to support the strength
of Great Britain. When, confiding in that strength, she
begins to forget from whence it arose, it will be an easy
thing to shew the source. She may readily be reminded
of the loud alarm spread among her merchants and tradesmen,
by the universal association of these colonies, at the
time of the Stamp-act, not to import any of her manufactures.&mdash;&mdash;In
the year 1718, the Russians and Swedes, entered
into an agreement, not to suffer Great-Britain to export
any naval stores from their dominions, but in Russian
or Swedish ships, and at their own prices. Great-Britain
was distressed. Pitch and tar rose to three pounds a barrel.
At length she thought of getting these articles from the
colonies; and the attempt succeeding, they fell down to
fifteen shillings. In the year 1756, Great Britain was threatened
with an invasion. An easterly wind blowing for six
weeks, she could not man her fleet, and the whole nation
was thrown into the utmost consternation. The
wind changed. The American ships arrived. The
fleet sailed in ten or fifteen days. There are some other
reflections on this subject worthy of the most deliberate
attention of the British parliament; but they are of such
a nature, I do not chuse to mention them publicly. I
thought I discharged my duty to my country, taking
the liberty, in the year 1765, while the Stamp-Act was in
suspense, of writing my sentiments to a man of the
greatest influence at home, who afterwards distinguished
himself by espousing our cause, in the debates concerning
the repeal of that act.</p></div>
